## To Improve

1. Add the feature to change players on the fly during the match for interchange players.
2. When entering recording page, a Cover Flow of team player's number is really confusing, user can misunderstand it as scores for teams, it's not intuitive.
3. While trying to show highlights in the player data or the team data, simply marking the best performed stat in red is an insanely bad idea. Red also represents negativity, this makes people think there is something wrong with data, or this could be a negative stat on this user.
