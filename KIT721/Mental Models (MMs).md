MM shows how user will think
- How a system works
- How it should work
- How it can be used to solve a problem
- How others will use it
it is bunch of signs that a person believes about something, MM strongly impacts all aspects of interaction, and mismatch could be common.

Designer's MM != User's
- Designer's MM is all about how the system works, and predicting, or shaping user's MM
	- Use cues (affordance), recognition & recall
- User's MM will contain
	- Beliefs about the system
		- What it does
		- What the UI elements mean
	- Relevant Background knowledge
		- Domain knowledge
		- OS

**How to address MM problems?**
- Fix the system: match with user's MM
	- Put the stuff in a "more right" place
- Fix the user: shape user's MM so they can reflect easier on your system
	- Better Affordances
	- Better Explanation
	- Better UI, elements, labelling...

User's MM is understood by **User Testing**
