A successful application:
- Useful: Do the required job
- Usable: Easy to use
- Used: People will want to use it

Four basic UCD activities:
- Identifying needs and establishing requirements.
- Developing alternative designs
- Interactive versions (Hi-Fi Prototype) to communicate and assess
- Evaluation
And it's a loop, every activity needs to connect with users.

Three characters of UCD:
- Users involved throughout the project
- Usability and UX goals specifically identified and documented
- Iteration through four basic activities

**Six Usability Goals**
- Learnable on first use
- Memorable on repeat uses
- Efficient
- Failure-resistant
- Forgiving
- Satisfying

**Design Principles**
(Don Norman's Design Principles)
- Visibility: State, possible actions
- Feedback: Ongoing tasks
- Affordance: Clues
- Mapping: Position and Relation
- Constraints: Limits
- Consistency: Similar operations and elements

Prototype: Early sample or model built to test a concept or process, goes up with fidelity.
Why: Communicating the ideas, with evaluation and feedback from user, with stakeholders, and with design/development teams.
Lo-Fi: Quick to construct with low cost, easy to do alternatives, with no or limited functionality, general look and feel, set expectations, identify problems.
Hi-Fi: Involves codes, final graphics, true interactions though can be up to changes. However, expensive, can only modify fit-and-finish and reluctant to change, designers and users may think they have the full system, can be stopped by small issues like bugs.
