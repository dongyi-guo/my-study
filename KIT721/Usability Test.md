Measurements
- Usability Test: invite intended users to the system and participate
- Usability Test Tasks: instructions in Usability Test, they are series tasks to complete, usually not step by step
- Success Requirements: if a Usability Test Task can be successfully done by the user

**Tasks and Success Requirements**
- Test if app meets success requirements, which means requirements are marked off by user doing tasks successfully
- Tasks should be representative for achieving goals in the app
- Tasks should be small, but not trivial to be step-by-step
- Tasks should be worded as if you are asking the user to do something
	- "You ...*condition*... , do ...*something*..."
	- It should be instructive, you are **telling** them what to do
- Tasks can vary in abstractness, but never leading.
	- Can be abstractive like "Enter your details"
	- Can be concrete like "Put 5 here"
- Tasks should be narrative in a scenario
	- "You are recording your gym activity"
- Use **Usability Task Matrix**
	- Requirements x Tasks
	- Tasks not useful can be found as no Requirements will be mapped to it
	- One Task can fill multiple Requirements, one Requirement can be mapped by multiple Tasks - "Matrix"
- Observe, to picture user's **Mental Model**
