# Activity Attributes 

This week is all about understanding Activities: the A of PACT

Activities: How people behave.

## Task Analysis:

* Understanding the task.
* Core of most works in HCI.
* Most powerful tools available.
* Is to know people's activity, and adopt technology accordingly.
* Know your targeted users, and satisfy their needs.

**Task**: A goal together with some ordered set of actions.
* It's the job to be accomplished by the user.
* Understanding tasks at hand is closely related to **Interaction Modelling** and **User Analysis** (System Development)
* Can be detailed into smaller levels until defined by an action (leaf).

**Task Analysis**: the study of how work is achieved by tasks.

**Task Analysis ended in a Task Model.**

There are 2 types of Task Analysis:
* Logic based.
* Cognitive based.

## Logic-Based Models

### Business Process Maps - Process

Process is:

* Structured.
* Measured.
* Set of activities designed to be output in a specific outcome.
* Set of value-add tasks, converting input to output.

#### Characteristics

* Must have a start and end.
* Start and end with a customer.
* Coordinated activities involving people, technology and others.
* Is a huge portion of organizational costs.
* Crosses organizational boundaries.

#### Elements

* Entities: Processes take place between inter-organizational entities.
* Objects: Processes end up in manipulating physical information objects.
* Activities: Processes involve managerial and operational activities.

A business process has an entity, object and activity.

Two main process in any organization:

* Workflow
* Information Flow

#### Tasks v.s. Process

* Task is the function of value-adding.
* Activity is what is happening in a process, it contains tasks.
* Process is the whole process of taking inputs, doing value-adding, and return a result.
* A main process take many functions, and they together contribute to a great deal of impact as an organization.
* We can make sub-process from main process, categorized by different goals.

#### Logic Process Maps

* Maps can be in different levels - macro (high) to micro (low).
    * Overview of the main process: macro
    * Someone is doing something: micro
* The level of mapping is driven by purpose.

Example: Relationship Map (Context Diagram)

* Shows supplier-customer relationships: how input and output are done.
* Least level of detail.
* Shows the big picture.
* Contains Interfaces and Boundaries
* Could involve External Agent (EA)

Example: Cross-functional Map View

* How an organization's major work process cut across several functions.
* Medium level of the detail.
* Shows Processes and People Interfaces.

Example: Flow Charts

* Show tasks.
* Most detailed one.
* Represents details of a task.

Example: Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

* Sequence of tasks in a structured diagram but act as a hierarchy.
* Unlocks iteration (loop).
* Unlocks selection (alternation).

### Cognitive Task Analysis

Example: GOMS - Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection (rules)

* Requires procedural knowledge.
* Goals: what people are trying to do.
* Operators: actions that systems allow user to perform.
* Methods: sequences of sub-tasks of the operators.
* Selection rules: rules that people use to choose between the methods.

Keys to success:

* The operating people must provide information to the map.
* Everyone involved must understand the process.
* The information involved must be valid.

Design Implications:

* Purpose of the task.
* Frequency of the activities.
* Time pressures.
* Will activities be interrupted?
* Appropriate response time.
* Alone or together work?
* Well-defined or vague.
* Safety-critical?
* What if mistakes happen?
* Data requirements.
* Representation Media.

## Scenarios

**Explains how the personas act.**

* Informal narrative description.
* Describe human activities or tasks in **story** which allows exploration and discussion of contexts, needs and requirements.

Personas + Scenarios = Core technique for interactive systems design

Scenarios help to:

* Understand current behaviours.
* Explore the constraints.

### Types of Scenarios

* Stories
* Conceptual Scenarios
* Concrete Scenarios
* Use Cases

### Level of detail

* Varies depending where scenarios are used in the development process.
* For requirements: emphasize the context, usability and UX goals, and tasks the user is performing.
* When used with detailed personas: To improve the UX.
* To describe an envisioned situation.

### Components of Scenarios

* Background: Who are the users and what are their skills?
* Motivation: What goals to achieve?
* Tasks: What must they do?
* Context: How will they use?
* Environment: Where will they attempt to use it?
* Challenges: What could be obstructions?
