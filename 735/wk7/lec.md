# Designing for Ease of Use and Usefulness (Concrete Design)

## Concrete Design

Difference between Conceptual Design and Concrete Design:

* A matter of changing emphasis.
* Conceptual issues will be highlighted.
* Concrete details will be stressed.

## Interactive Design Development Cycle

* Starting by Establishing requirements.
* Go to and Go back from Designing alternatives.
* Designing alternatives go to and go back from Prototyping.
* Prototyping go to Evaluating, which can easily go back to Establishing requirements and Designing alternatives, Or make the final delivery.

## Design Principles

* Practice within the context of actual development that one must make difficult choices.

Narrative:
* Helping people access.
    * Visibility
    * Consistency
    * Familiarity
    * Affordance 
* Giving people sense control.
    * Navigation
    * Control
    * Feedback
    * Provide Safety
        * Recovery
        * Constraints
* Knowing what to do and how to do.
* Suiting the user in.
    * Flexibility
    * Style
    * conviviality

10 Principles:

* Inclusive
* Stress-free
* Intuitive
* Problem-solver
* Suitable 
* Friendly
* Satisfies the senses
* Altruist
* Blends into the environment
* Thoughtful

## Design Laws

### Jakob's Law

"User will prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know."

* User will transfer expectations they built before.
* You can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks by leveraging existing mental models.
* Make a familiar version when you want to impose changes.

### Fitt's Law

"Time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target."

* Targets should be large enough for users to accurately select.
* Targets should have ample spacing between them.
* Targets should be positioned to be easily acquired.

### Hick's Law

"Time to make a decision increased with the number and complexity of choices."

* Minimize choices.
* Tasks in smaller steps, less cognitive load.
* AVOID highlight recommendations.
* Use progressive on-boarding.
* DO NOT simplify the abstraction.

### Postel's Law

"Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you send."

* Be empathetic, flexible and tolerant to any user actions.
* Anticipate virtually anything, they more anticipation, the more resilience the design has.
* Accept user inputs, convert to requirements and give feedbacks.

### Aesthetic-Usability Effect

"Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable."

* Create a positive response in people's mind and leads them to believe things work better.
* People will be more tolerate to minor usability issues.
* Visual pleasing can mask usability flaws.

### Von Restorff Effect - The Isolation Effect

"When multiple similar objects are present, the one differs a lot from others tend to be remembered."

* Make important information or key actions visually distinctive.
* Use restraint, so salient items don't get mistakenly identified as ads.
* Don't exclude people.
* Carefully treat users with all levels of sensitivities.

### Tesler's Law - The Law of Conservation of Complexity

"For any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced."

* Complexity can be unavoidable, just try to reduce user's burden as much as possible, without simplifying on the abstraction.

### Doherty Threshold

"Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms> that ensures that neither has to wait on the other."

* Provide system feedback within 400ms.
* Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or precessing is in background.
* Progress bar to make it more tolerable.
* Adding a delay to unify experience.

### Miller's Law

"The avaerage person can only keep 7 +-2 items in their working memory.
