**1. Remember â€“ From memory and in your own words provide a definition of concrete design.**

Concrete design is the section where the details are settled, it is influenced, or even based by the conceptual design - by evaluating on how users think, but lands the technology, use cases into the ground and trying to deliver a friendly, easy, coherent and comfortable user experience.

**2. Understand: Describe why concrete design is important in a user-centred design process, and how it helps support technology acceptance.**

Concrete design is the first stage where some final features, elements, frameworks or any implementations that could meet the user in the end, it is the first stop of a designer trying to being a product into real world. In a PACT analysis model, it mostly covers the Technology section as it is the part where technology stacks get solidified. 

**3. Apply: Read the following Tutorial Case study, and refer to your consolidated PACT analysis, and your low-fidelity sketch.  Compile a list of the variables laws and principles that support design decisions. For each, provide a brief explanation in your own words and describe how it could be applied to inform design decisions.**

* Inclusive - The system is all about recreational fishers.
* Stress-free - The system does not have emergencies that users are required to fulfill.
* Intuitive - The system uses a touchscreen.
* Problem-solver - The system is aiming to aid recreational fisher's fishing activities and promote sustainable fishing.
* Suitable - The system works on smartphones, which can be easily carried on boats.
* Friendly - The system always aims to be as friendly as possible.
* Satisfies the senses - The system provides all the functions quite directly, user will immediately feel this is the app for them if some of the functions are what they are looking forward to.
* Altruist - The system helps, with a goal.
* Blends into the environment - The system follows design principle of the platform it is on and works well.
* Thoughtful - The system considers all above.
* Jakob's Law - The system takes approach as mobile website and apps to utilize user's previous knowledge on using a mobile web app or native app.
* Hick's Law - The system only implements one layer of menu - the main tab bar at the bottom of the user interface and does not introduce other secondary actions for any functions and settings to keep user on track of what they are trying to do instead of being distracted hard.
* Postel's Law - The system has detailed descriptions of functions, features and contents that it provides, but the UI element to access or control them is either short text or icon. 
* Aesthetic-Usability Effect - The system follows design principles on the platforms it runs in order to provide an unified look with other system elements and support some functions that are provided by the system. 
* Von Restorff Effect (The Isolation Effect) - The system uses very different elements to address some of the features and functions , for example the countdown of distressed call, it is very outstanding and obvious. 
* Tesler's Law (The Law of Conservation of Complexity) - The system still requires lists or columns of buttons to make some hierarchical structures for functions in order to management. This complexity will be introduced but will be fine.
* Doherty Threshold - The system will use multi-threading to minimize the lag of the system run by utilizing the multi-core CPU on modern smartphones.
* Miller's Law - The system won't have over 7 similar elements together
