# Understanding Human (People Attributes)

## PACT - Framework of designing interactive systems

It follows an Human Centered Design - both Analysis and Design.

It evaluates Current situation -> possible improvements -> envision futures.

Main idea: people carry ideas in contexts while using technologies.

Components

* People
* Activity
* Context
* Technology

This requires you to know the user: their needs, preferences, tendencies, capabilities and skill levels.

In this week, we study on the People attribute.

## Physical Differences

US Air Force designed their flights on measurements of pilot's average - It suits absolutely no one.

It is also called Human Factors and Ergonomics.

Physical differences make design implications:
* Contributing to musculoskeletal pain.
* More than twice the amount of repetitive motion.
* Beneficial effects on employee mental health.

## Psychological Differences

What is psychological difference? 

It is someone can be better at:

* Attention
* Memory
* mentally rotate objects
* Good at words
* Good at numbers
* Personality
* Emotional make-up
* Working under pressure
* Recognizing
* Quickly grasp how something works
* Different experiences -> conceptual models

### Cognition

#### Attention

* Select things to concentrate on.
* Focus on information that is relevant.
* Attention is brief.
* Intake and process Information.

Design Implications: 
* People form first impression within half a second.
* Attend the information, use techniques and cluttering the interface.

#### Recognition

* Design interfaces promote this.
* Provide user various of ways to encode information.

#### Learning

* How easy it is to accomplish a task in the first time.
* How many repetitions will it take for a user to become efficient. 
* User prefers learning via doing.

Design Implication:
* Encourage Exploration
* Constrain and guide users
* Link abstract and concrete
* User prefers other sites - user will prefer the site to work as others.

#### Memory

* Recalling some knowledge.
* Filtering, as we don't remember everything.
* Various to person, cause stumbling blocks.
* Make people's life easy.

**Types**:

* Sensory memory (seconds)
* Short-term memory (STM)
    * Rapidly accessed, recalled, decays and limited capacity.
    * Processes sensory memories which are of interest to us.
    * Interaction are mainly sensory or STM.
* Minutes
* Mezzanine memory
* Hours/days
* Long-term memory (LTM)
* Lifetime

Design Implications
* As little memory load as possible, less burden, make your guidance quick and easy.
* Miller's Law: Capacity of human short-term memory is about 5-7 chunks of information.

#### Perception

* How information is acquired from the environment -> Senses
* Sight and sound are the widely accepted.
* Sight: Most important of senses
* Sound: Grab attention, to provide feedback to indicate what is happening, and to entertain
* Touch: Haptic

Design Implications: 
* Not everyone has it - alternatives must be provided.
* Information must be perceptible and recognisable across different media.  
* Graphical representations must distinguish their meaning.
* Group your information with borders.
* The speech should distinguish between the set of spoken words.
* Text should be legible and distinguishable.
* Allow users to recognize various touch sensations.
* Audible and distinguishable sounds.

#### Decision Making, Planning, Reasoning, Problem Solving

* What to do.
* What options to have.
* What consequences. 

Design Implications:

* Provide just enough information in the right form.
* Provide hidden information that is easy to access for users who intend to access to it.
* Use simple and memorable functions.

#### Reading, Speaking, Listening

* The ease and simplicity is the key.

Design Implications:

* Text to a minimum.
* Spoken menus less than 3 options.
* People are bad at remembering instructions.
* Human voices are easier to understand.
* Text larger to have better visibility. 

### Mental Models

* Somebody understands how things are likely to be.
* People tend to have different mental models.

If people don't have a mental model, they will perform actions by rote (copying).

* And if things go wrong, they cannot recover
* A key design principle is to design things so that people will for the correct and useful mental models.

### Cognitive Overload

* You need to know people's capability and research on it.
* Contributes to your Technology Acceptance.

## Social Connectedness

People are inherently social, social interactions are central to day to day life.

Concerns on people's

* Thoughts
* Feelings
* Actions
* Technotonicity: how technology makes people feel.
* Trust: how people feel when they interact with each other.

Design Implications become understanding user's needs and wants on social connection.

## Personas: Representations of people for design

Personas are representation of your users who combines the same needs, desires and pain points.

Personas are probably the most important document you will create for analyzing your users, as you are studying for the most important person for your system and it gathers the psychological, behavioral and demographical information. 

They are your target users, it leads to the success directly.

A system could target different personas, so a system could have many.

**Types:**

* Traditional Personas
  * Actual representation.
  * Information gathered by interacting with actual users
* Proto-Personas
  * Entirely based on assumptions about your internal stakeholders.
  * Should be later checked.
  * Make you start without immediate access to your potential user.

You create the persona based on the goal you are trying to achieve.

What does it have?

* Name and Photo
* Demographics
* Attitudes and Behaviors
* Goals & Motivations
* Needs & Fears
* Technological Expertise
* Personal Motto
