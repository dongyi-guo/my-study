**1. Remember â€“ In your own words describe the design evaluation activity, the main types of evaluation that can be undertaken, and its main aims towards technology acceptance.**

There are lots of design principles, laws, techniques and methodologies that guide and aid us to build an interactive design, but how could we know and measure our design in a scale of user-friendliness, ease of use, so on and on which will contribute to a good interactive design? Evaluation hence kicks in, which is also an integrated stage of creating an interactive design to help us measure our design's quality, find acceptance of our system to our potential users and locate any issues and flaws our system so it can be fixed as soon as possible since it is cheaper to correct things in our development at early stages.

Speaking them in different types of evaluation, we have:

* **Controlled Settings**: This is the evaluation with the most strict environment controls, in this type of evaluation, users or participants are asked to be put into a very controlled environment or Context from PACT Analysis, given seqences of tasks to perform and goal to hit, with only one simple variable that would be changed for comparing. This evaluation is fully constructed to find implications of one simple factor.
* **Natural Settings**: This evaluation comes with a context or environment with much loose and flexible rules or settings, the reason is one of the core aim of this design is to find while the system being used what kind of impact could be brought by the context during its usagem, we want the tests to happen in the most natural way of how user is using the system.
* **Setting not involving users**: This evaluation happens when design team is really limited to have access to target users, such as kids, patients with mobility issues, or simply we just don't have any this kind of desired users around us. We may have some proxy like parents of kids, doctors of patients or we can just simply observe to retrieve some helpful feedback.

**2. Understand: What is a heuristic? How are these useful to commencing an evaluation of a design?**

Heuristic is the type of evaluation you bring your work to the experts who are already way experienced and professional in related area. We, as designers, could have various level of knowledge and understandings on how to design a user-friendly interactive design, and we most likely could have so many different ideas, and they all come down from applying techniques, principles, laws and methodologies. Are they actually hitting the criteria? Will our personal / targeted user actually like them? Our recognization, as we are the one who designed them, could be very biased. An HCI professional or expert at this moment could be beyond helpful and align our work with an well-assessing critiera. Basically you give your assessing checklist, criteria and final goal to someone else and let them check that thing for you.

**3. Apply: Do some independent research to find 5 examples of heuristics that can help you start to evaluate your own designs.**
