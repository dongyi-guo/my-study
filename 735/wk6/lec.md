# Conceptual Design - Design for Ease of Use and Usefulness

## Interactive Design Development Cycle

* Identifies 4 activities.
* They inform one another.
* Repeated during the development of interactive software.
* Starts once some requirements established.

## Generating Alternatives

* A key principle in most design disciplines, should be encouraged.
* Core activity of designing.

## Conceptual & Concrete Design

Conceptual Design is about how users can understand the system, and Concrete Design is the actual system and how they are using it.

### Conceptual Design

* Conceptual Design involves producing the Conceptual Model.
* Conceptual design is concerned with transforming requirements into a conceptual model

#### Conceptual Model - Mental Model

* **RESTRAINT YOURSELF from making an actual system!!!**
* Describe an Abstraction outlining what people can do with a product.
* Abstract, Psychological representations of tasks being carried out.
    * TASKS, not keystroke, mouse-clicks.
    * Is what can be done and what to aware.
    * UI will be built on the model.
    * If you don't, just jump into UI, your system is going to be arbitrary, incoherent and complex.
* Simple as possible.
* Focused on the task-domain.
* Idealized view of how the system works.
* Ontological structure of the system.
* Which users accomplish the tasks being supported.
* Emerge from the current functional requirements.
    * May be a subset of them.
    * May be all of them.
    * May be an extended version of them.
* Concepts need to understand how to interact with the product based on variety of issues related to who the user will be.
* Fundamental for interaction design, tho ideas can be hard to find.
* Conceptual models can be in many forms. Not possible to be definitive.
* Conceptual modelling can be carried out at a very early point in the design cycle.
    * So there could be a basic understanding of how user's conceive tasks can be brought to bear on the UI design.

Why?

* Provides how your application will work.
* Match the way your application works with the mental models of your users.
* Unlocks the vision of how well your conceptual model matches different mental models.
* Examine whether the mental model is aligned with the conceptual model or not, so you can decide to shift one of them.
* Echoing conceptual models enables designers to build the system on existing knowledge and frameworks, so user can have less learning costs.

Cool, so what goes in it?

* Tasks - explained in user's tongue.
* Objects - physical objects that a user relates to.
* Actions and attributes (of your object)
    * What can user do.
    * What attributes will that have.
* Terminology Definitions - Standardized

Conceptual model provides and understanding of:

* What tasks to conduct.
* Objects will work within the system.
* Relationships that objects have to each other.
* Actions that user can take using the objects.
* Attributes associated with each object.
* Language used to describe objects, attributes, etc.

Basically it makes you easier to stand in the user's shoes and make sure your products is intuitive and usable enough.

Also, make sure it can be understandable by the users, but it's not actually how to design a system.

What's the relation between Conceptual model to the PACT Analysis?

* ACT.
* Interaction and Interface types.
* Functions.
* Relationships.
* What information?

## Lo-fi Prototype (Low Fidelity)

Fidelity: how the prototype conveys the look-and-fell of the final product, in terms of detail and realism.

Lo-fi prototyping is used to translate high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts.

* Most important role is to check and test functionality.

Lo-fi prototype allows:

* Getting quicker and potentially more feedback.
* A/B testing being done faster / easier / cheaper.
* Focusing on flow and functionality.

### Types of Lo-fi Prototypes:

* Storyboards
    * Graphic organizer.
    * Visually present information.
        * Users, tasks, goals.
        * Linear, hierarchical, non-linear, composite.
* Sketching
    * Pen and paper
    * Tasks, objects, and actions.
* Wireframes
    * Representation of an interface
    * Contains details:
        * Structure: how will the pieces of this site be put together?
        * Content - have what will be displayed on the site?
        * Informational hierarchy - how is this the information organized and displayed?
        * Functionality - how will this interface work?
        * Behaviour- how does it interact with the user? And how does it behave?
