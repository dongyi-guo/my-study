# Literature Review

## Why

* To familiarise yourself with the knowledge.
* Know what has been done, prevent duplication and credit others.
* Identify issues from gaps in research, conflicts in previous studies, open questions left.
* Identify needs, justify why we research.
* Place your own research within the context of exisiting literature, explain why further.

## Critical Thinking

Identify reliable information and make reliable judgements, encompasses mindset and skillsd to make you understand key concepts, practice and application.

* Reasoning
* Identifying
* Analysing
* Reflecting
* Evaluating

### Reasoning

Ability to think logically and formulate fair judgements.

* Where are the arguments?
* What is the purpose of arguments?
* Types:
    * Inductive (observation > general principles)
        * Sample has A, so population has A.
    * Deductive (general principles > special cases)
        * Population has A, so sample has A.

### Identifying

* When was the information there?
* Is it relevant?
* Who produced the information?
* For what purpose?
* How accurate?

### Analysing

Examine the information so we can understand, interpret and explain it.

* Why did author write this? Is there bias?
* Why did author make such assumptions?
* Why was certain evidence presented?
* How does the evidence support (or disapprove) the conclusions reached
* Who can benefit? Could there be conflicts of the interest.
* Is there any information that has been omitted? If yes why?

### Reflecting

Consider:

* What happened?
* Why did it happen?
* How do you felt about it?
* How did it impact you?
* How may you respond or adapt in the future?

Avoid the biases, preconditioned perceptions and judgements will affect your reasoning.

### Evaluating:

Make judgements and decisions:

* So what?
    * Implications
    * Your own thinking.
    * Value of this information.
* Now what?
    * What else is needed? Future investigation?

## Critical Thinker

* Interpret.
* Analyse.
* Assess
* Sort out
* Reach accurate conclusions.

* Goal -> what do I know, what I need to figure out.
* Well-focused questions -> fact or opinion.
* Clarity, consistency and accuracy -> how to I know this.
* Reasoning
* Causes and Effects
* Bias
* Alternatives

## Writing your literature review:

* Introduction
* Main Body
* Conclusion

## Week 8 - Critical Thinking

### Learning Activity 1

**First Paper:**

Rationale:

* Conflicting reports about the effect of ICT on student's academic performance.
* It's not missing, but you could surely could have more.

Literature Review:

(Make sure in your assignment, don't make 5 paragraphs only for introducing the topic)
(But get details)

* The introduction.
* No, you need more details.
* Yes, the last paragraphs.
* I don't think so, it's there but should be better.

Research Question:

* No, because it's exploratory.
* No.
* No.

**Second Paper:**

Rationale:

* Previous research studies about ICT and students' performance does not establish precisely the impact of ICT on student's performance. But technology is everywhere, how could this be ICT changing everything.
* Yes, they mentioned some scenarios of students using ICT, definitions about academic and quoting contents here and there.

Literature Review:

* No, you need to have more supportive evidences, don't do that in your assignment.
* The left part in second page.
* Yes.
* Yes, logic is there, its just better if we have more evidence.
* Yes very much.

Research Question:

* Yes they do, the two challenges.
* Yes
* Yes

### Learning Activity 2

* No
* No, as the rationale are straight up different.
* Comparing
    * Second one better.
    * Second one better.
    * Second one better as their scope is larger (4 universities).
