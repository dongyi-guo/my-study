**1. How do you feel about the outline of this unit? Do you feel rushed? Do you feel teared up? How compatible do you think this unit's outline are with your other units?**

Students in our tutorial are generally okay about the unit outline. Overall-progress-wise they don't feel rushed and students feel lectorial and tutorial are connected. There are some students showed interests and supports about making practical exercises the main parts of our assessments, but there are also students thinking having 4 practical exams is too many, and they prefer the 2 practical exams outline like in 501/715. Students think the unit actually collaborates with our units plan well as all other units just won't stop being torturous the week after the mid-break, students are grateful this unit does not do that.

**2. How do you feel about the workload about this unit? How often do you feel like "Ah, this is it, I tried my best"?**

Students in our tutorial are okay with the workload of the unit. Overall-task-wise they think it's fair amount of the work. However, I did collect one student's idea outside our tutorial think Module 3 (Tutorial 9 - 15) is too massive, and one student thinks the unit should be split into two: one teaching OS and another teaching applications and security.

The problem that did rise, is the exam time. Majority of our students think the exam is extremely rushed, stuffed and lack of flexibility. Students feel current practical exam loads should deserve 45-60 minutes for time, and the quiz exam should not be put together with practical exams and for quiz exam they want some flexibility, like available for a whole day and they can do this regardless where they are.

**3. How do you feel about being supported? This is in terms of teaching stuffs (Unit Coordinator and Tutor) and materials (Lectorial, Tutorial, LabShare or Network Labs)?**

Students feel really supported during their study for these units, as we are the only 376 tutorial on Tuesday, most of us come into the tutorial 1-2 hours early, and we will stay or come into the labs for extra practices. It is observable that this is the case for students in other tutorials as well. Students generally think LabShare is okay, Student thinks the lectorial and tutorial material are really great and detailed.

Students in our tutorial speak highly for the teaching team, especially the unit coordinator (All the love for David), they think this unit is so well-structured and well-paved with loads of contents, and the reason is because of our unit coordinator. It is well known that students enrol in this unit, or Cybersecurity specialization because of our unit coordinator and students will lure students from other specializations to our unit coordinator's units. Students also speak very highly about our tutor (The Legendary Luke), there are 3 students in our classes having working arrangement difficulties, but stayed for attempt to work through this semester with our tutor.

I did collect one student from another tutorial mentioning there is less help received from our teaching teams for tutorial content.

**4. How much do you think you are involved in this unit's study? Does the topic in this unit intrigue you? Do you have motivations other than "OK I need to graduate"? Do you feel engaged by the teaching?**

Although I personally get highly intrigued by this unit's content and material, and I have friends in another tutorial favored the content so much as well, in this tutorial students are averagely not heated up for the content and have other motivations. However, they do feel well-supported by our teaching teams and peers and their study is highly involved with others.

**5. How do you think this unit's experience can benefit you in your planned future? Study-wise or work-wise?"**

Most students in our tutorial don't know as they think they will need to find this out in the future. 3 students in this tutorial (me included) and around 5 students outside this tutorial, especially who have already determined their System Admin/ Network Admin/ Cybersecurity career pathway think this unit is going be very beneficial for our future career or study.

After finishing these 5 pulled-up questions, open-ended questions are asked, students repeat the need and desire of increasing the test time, separating practical and quiz tests, reducing the number of practical tests (715 style), and provide some flexibility on tests.
