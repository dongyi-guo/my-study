# Penetration Testing

* Aware with knowledge and tools for 715 and 726.
* Need 1-2 years of training only for this.

## What is it?

* Evaluation of the security 
    * Where are you vulnerable

## Goals

Find flaws in :

* Policies
* Specificatons
* Architecture
* Implementation
* S/w
* H/w

and more.

## Legal Considerations

Because it is simulating what could be malicious, so BE CONSENTED. Permission must be obtained.

You can not interrupt the normal business working.

## Type of Test

**Black-box (Zero-knowledge) Testing**

* You are outsiders.

**White-box (Inside-knowledge) Testing**

* Will reveal more vul
* and faster
* Internal
* Glass-box test

**Grey-box Testing**

* Some knowledge but not all the knowledge

## Structure of a Test

There is no fixed structure, depending on the goals

Full-system could be 4 stages, could be more, all about how you draw the line and considering the goal settings

Stage 1 - Scope/Goal:

What this company wants to test?

Stage 2 - Information Gathering / Footprinting / Reconnanc

Stage 3 - Scanning / Enumeration / Vulnerability Detection 

Firewall VPN probing could be logged

even if used jquery 

Stage 4 - information analysis and planning

Stage 5 - Attack & Penetration / Privilege escalation / Maintain access (backdoor)

You repeat Stage 2 - 5 to discover all vulnerabilities in the system

Stage 6 - Documentation result analysis & reporting

Stage 7 - Clean-up

This should also be the responsibility for the clients.

## Open Problems

Analysis Phase

* Tricky
* Time consuming
* Need high l skills
* As PenTester, you need to think out of the box for you own jobs, but no bad intentions

Pen Stage:

* Tools are unified
* Need config
* Need deep understanding of the computer architecture.
* Does not mean your client is safe now

Responding the incidents

* If 

Clean-up can be difficult, especially for clients
