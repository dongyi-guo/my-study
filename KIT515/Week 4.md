## Information Asset Components

* Hardware
* Software
* Data
* Business

### Hardware Assets

* Hardware assets include servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, removable media, networking and telecommunications equipment, and peripheral equipment.
* Key concerns are loss of a device, through theft or damage, and lack of availability of the device for an extended period.
* Another concern is device malfunction, due to deliberate malfunction or other causes.
* Asset valuation needs to take into account the replacement cost of the hardware, disruption losses, and recovery expenses.

### Software Assets

* Software assets include applications, operating systems and other system software, virtual machine and container virtualisation software, software for software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualisation (NFV), database management systems, file systems, and client and server software.
* Availability is a key consideration here, and asset valuation must take account of disruption losses and recovery expenses.

* Documents important security-related information for each asset.

## Asset Identification and Classification

* Classification of all information assets by **Criticality** and **Sensitivity**
    * the impact of a security compromise of those assets is important to maintain effective information security.

**Methodology**: Having different ratings based on those two.

## CIA: Information Impact Levels

Security Category (SC) of an information system can be expressed:

```
SC(info_asset)={(confidentiality,impact),(integrity,impact),(availability,impact)}, where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high.
```
