# Implementation and Training

## Implementation

Implementation: Put new procedures into place and being following the new controls.
* Robust technical configurations.
* Manual and procedural controls, implement new workflows and review activities and performance.
* Starts by making sure everyone involved understands the intent of the policy and how it will be applied.
* Decisions made by purchase and configuration of supporting controls and any capital investments.

## Communication:

Objective: deliver the message that the policy is important to the organization.

Requirement: visible leadership.

Security is not always convenient, and it is crucial for leadership to participate in the information security program by adhering to its policies and setting the example.
* It is the responsibility of the CEO and leadership team to protect the business and its data by identifying threats, understanding the impact of these threats, and taking appropriate action to protect the business against these threats.

## Dissemination

Objective: making it available.

Policies should be widely distributed and available to their intended audience.

Due to confidentiality, certain policies may not always need to be available to everyone and should only be made available on a need-to-know basis.

To maximise the impact of policy:
* Awareness raising
* Understanding objectives
* Engagement with targeted stakeholders

### Dissemination Planning

1. What you intend to disseminate.
2. Identifying target users.
3. Effective channels.
4. Evaluating success.

## Training

> Check Importance from NIST in lecture.

Everyone is involved, except:

* Agency heads
* Chief Information Officers (CIOs)
* Program Officials
* IT security program manages
* Whoever have key responsibilities to ensure effectiveness across the agency.

### Scope

* It must be tied to existing security program directives and established agency security policy.
* Within agency IT security program policy, there must exist clear requirements for the **(a) awareness** and training program
* According to NIST, it is a resource from which organisations or sectors can develop additional publications or tools that meet their needs to define or provide guidance on different aspects of workforce development, planning, **(b) training**, and **(c)education**.

### Awareness

According to NIST: Awareness is not training. The purpose of awareness presentations is simply to focus attention on security.

Awareness presentations are intended to allow individuals to recognize IT security concerns and respond accordingly

When developing:
* Focus on people
* Refrain from using technical jargon
* Define learning objectives, state them clearly, and provide sufficient details and coverage
* Keep things light
* Help users understands their roles in Information security
* Make the awareness program formal; plan and document all actions
* Provide good information early, rather than perfect information late

Techniques:

* Videos
* Posters and banners
    * Check lecture for more
* Lectures and conferences
* Newsletters
* Brochures and flyers

### Training

* Provides hands-on instruction to prepare people.
* In-house training.
* Formal training such as conferences or programs.

According to NIST: Training seeks to teach skills, which allow a person to perform a specific function.

Training is generally attended by those tasked with implementing and monitoring security control.

Training can be customised by:

* Functional Background
    * General User
    * Managerial User
    * Technical User
* Skill Level
    * Novice
    * Intermediate
    * Advanced

Delivery method:

* One-on-one
* Formal Class
* Computer-Based Training (CBT)
* Distance learning / Web Seminars
* User Support Group
* On-the-job training
* Self-Study (Non-computerised)

### Education

According to NIST: the ‘Education’ level integrates all of the security skills and competencies of the various functional specialties into a common body of knowledge, adds a multidisciplinary study of concepts, issues, and principles (technological and social), and strives to produce IT security specialists and professionals capable of vision and pro-active response.

* Everyone in an organization needs to be trained and aware of information security; not every member needs a formal degree or certificate in security.
* When formal education is deemed appropriate, an employee can investigate degree programs or courses in continuing education from local institutions of higher learning.
* Knowledge Driven.
* It is management-oriented.
* It is generally targeted to those who are involved in the decision-making process
    * Classifying information, choosing controls, and evaluating and reevaluating security strategies
* The information owner charges these responsibilities.
