**Disclaimer**

This collection of feedback was conducted at the Week 10 tutorial. To engage our follow students to provide feedback, four questions of different aspects of this unit were pulled up. Open-ended questions such as likes/dislikes/suggestions were welcomed following as well. However, as students poured out their thoughts during the closed questions, there was not anything new in the open question section. Hence, all the feedback collected are presented as these four question's answers. There is a TL;DR followed by concluding student's likes and dislikes during this unit's teaching, then each question and its concluded answers will be put after the TL;DR.

**TL;DR**

Likes:

* The weekly content and assignment information are released early, giving student chance to prepare and avoid piling up works with other units.
* The teaching team is giving many supports on their works, our tutor Yanyu has been extremely helpful.
* This unit engages Fortinet certificates, which is one of the essential parts for job seeking, students appreciate the job relevancy this unit introduces.

Yikes:

* Tutorials, lectures, and assignments feel disconnected with each other, although each week they are under the same topic, lectures focus heavily on introducing general features of the discussed topics, while in tutorials and assignments we are required to do specific tasks with limited instructions from lectures and must-see items (as they are general) and no clue of expected outcome, making students feel lost and confused when they jumped on the tutorial and assignment work. They feel if lectures could give more instructions, pre-heat them with some practical examples will clear this issue.
* Students feel the specification of assignments could be more specific, such as giving clearly what items, subheadings and contents are expected, and the assignment scope could be less open. Students feel vague about how to do the assignment and get marks because of these reasons.
* Students feel the tutorial work is bit overloaded, it is quite impossible to finish everything during the two-hour tutorial session, working before and after the tutorial is a must.
* Students wish information such as exam dates is given earlier.

**1. How do you feel about learning in this unit so far? Do you feel overloaded? How do you feel about the content? Do you feel the distribution and connection of the theoretical and practical contents in this unit?**

Students feel engaged, attracted, and have strong willings to deep dive in this unit's content, making the learning interesting. Students feel the workloads are right on the spot, they admire the study pattern of transmitting the theoretical knowledges into practices in the tutorial. However, they feel it would be better if they can acquire clearer and more specific instructions and more samples from the lecture which will elaborate on tutorial and assignment works. Students also feel it would be better if the specification in assignment can be more detailed, clearly giving the structure of what are expected.

**2. How do you feel about the timeline of this unit? This includes the do you feel this is going to be a bit rushed on the schedule?**

Students in our tutorial are quite happy about the schedule of the unit as the materials and assignment specifications are released long time before the deadline, this gives enough room for students to plan and work ahead, hence, students can mitigate the effect of overload and rush by their own. Students agreed the progress of content push are exactly the right amount and fit into the time of the assignment, they suggested keeping the momentum.

One thing students feel a little bit rushed, is the tutorial work. Majority of the students in our tutorial feels impossible to finish the tutorial work during the two-hour interval of the class. Working before the tutorial or after the tutorial is a must. Students expect there could be a change on tutorial's workload rearrangement, or maybe increase the part of content in lecture which could help student working on tutorial contents, so they can work faster.

**3. How do you feel about being supported? This is in terms of teaching stuffs (Unit Coordinator and Tutor), materials (Lecture, Tutorial, Must-see Items and so on), and infrastructure (Lab Computers). If you feel there is lacking support what could be improved to better support you?**

Students appreciate the hard works from the teaching team, especially from our tutor, Yanyu has been very supportive for our tutorial works, she always carefully checks all the aspects that could contribute to our work's quality and gives clear instructions of what to do next.

**4. How much do you think you are involved in this unit's study? Does the topic in this unit intrigue you? Do you have motivations such as "This is fun!", "I am going to learn this to find a job" other than "OK I just need to graduate, let's get this through". Do you feel engaged by the teaching? Do you think this unit's experience can benefit you in your planned future? If your answer is negative, what do you think could be there to engage you more in the study?**

All students in our tutorial feel they devoted as much as possible into this unit already. One of the most important aspects keeping them intrigued and motivated is the job relevance of this unit: lots of concepts and activities we learned this unit are either directly what we need to do during a cybersecurity personnel or indirectly helping us to build knowledge of similar workflow, and the Fortinet certificate engagement is the most straight-forward accelerant for students to rise their career awareness, hence, they feel like they should devote in this unit. Students would like to see such engagements provisioning them insights of work continuously run in this unit.

After finishing these four pulled-up questions, open-ended questions are asked. Students appreciated again on teaching teams hard work, then we welcomed our tutor back.
