# Risk Analysis, Risk and Threat Assessment

## Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Controls

* Vulnerability: Weakness in a security system.
* Threat: circumstances that have a potential to cause harm.
* Controls: means and ways to block a threat, which tries to exploit one or more vulnerabilities.

## Threats Sources

1. Human Threats
2. Environmental Threats
3. Business Resources Threats

## Identification

### Hardware

* Physical theft or loss of devices such as laptops, smartphones, or servers.
* Destruction or damage of hardware due to natural disasters or accidents.
* Unauthorized access or tampering of hardware components such as routers, switches, or firewalls.

### Software

* Malware such as viruses, worms, or trojans that can infect software programs.
* Exploits or vulnerabilities in software that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or control.
* Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that can overwhelm software systems and render them unavailable.

### Data

* Data breaches or leaks that can result in the exposure of sensitive information such as personal information, financial data, or intellectual property.
* Insider threats such as employees or contractors who intentionally or unintentionally access or disclose sensitive data.
* Ransomware attacks that can encrypt or block access to data until a ransom is paid.

### Business

* Social engineering attacks such as phishing or spear-phishing that target individuals in an organization to gain access or information.
* Supply chain attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in third-party vendors or suppliers to gain access to an organization's systems or data.
* Advanced persistent threats (APTs) that use sophisticated techniques to gain access and maintain a long-term presence within an organization's systems or networks.

## Vulnerability Identification

* Process of identifying vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threats to cause harm to assets.
* Vulnerability: a weakness or a flaw in a system’s security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited when a threat is manifested.

### Hardware

* Lack of physical security measures, such as no access control, unsecured server rooms.
* Weak passwords or easily guessable default credentials on hardware devices.
* Vulnerable firmware or software running on the hardware, such as outdated firmware on a router.

### Software

* Unpatched vulnerabilities in software applications or
operating systems.
* Malicious code that exploit software vulnerabilities such as viruses, worms, Trojans.
* Social engineering attacks that trick users into installing malware or sharing sensitive information.

### Data

* Lack of access controls, such as weak or no passwords, insufficient role-based access controls.
* Data leaks caused by unsecured database or file storage.
* Insider threats.

### Business

* Lack of employee security awareness training.
* Inadequate incident response planning.
* Poor network segmentation or lack of proper network architecture.

## Threats and Vulnerabilities

Threat: The potential for a threat agent to intentionally or accidentally exploit a vulnerability.

Vulnerability: A weakness in a system’s security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls.

* A threat acting on a vulnerability produces a security violation, or breach.
* The level of risk is a measure that an organization can use in assessing the need for and the expected cost of taking remedial action in the form of risk treatment.

## Control

Controls are means and ways to block a threat, which tries to exploit one or more vulnerabilities.

### Hardware Control Identification

* Physical access controls: such as security cameras, key card systems, biometric authentication, and security guards.
* Environmental controls: such as air conditioning, fire suppression, and backup power supplies.
* Network security controls: such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and VPNs.

### Software Control Identification

* Access controls: such as usernames and passwords, multifactor authentication, and privilege management.
* Patch management: ensuring that software is kept up-to-date with the latest security updates.
* Antivirus and anti-malware software: scanning for and preventing viruses and other malicious software from entering the system.

### Data Control Identification

* Access controls: ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.
* Backup and recovery controls: ensuring that data is regularly backed up and can be recovered in case of data loss or corruption.
* Data classification controls: classifying data based on its sensitivity and putting appropriate security controls in place.
* Data retention controls: ensuring that data is only retained for as long as necessary and is securely disposed of when no longer needed.
* Encryption: protecting data both in transit and at rest.

### Business Control Identification

* Security policies and procedures: establishing and enforcing policies and procedures to ensure security best practices are followed.
* Risk management: identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks to the organization.
* Personnel security: conducting background checks and training employees on security awareness.
* Business continuity and disaster recovery: ensuring that the organization can continue operating in the event of a disaster or disruption.

## Risk, and Risk Management

Risk: an object, person or any entity that could harm, danger and make loss on your assets.

Risk management is to identify, assess, and evaluate the level of risk.

### Risk Assessment

**It is the process of determining the likelihood of the threat being exercised against the vulnerability and the resulting impact from a successful compromise.** It assigns scores to specific information asset to be evaluated, it provides a basis for establishing policies and selecting cost-effective techniques to implement these policies.

### Role of Risk Assessment
The benefits of risk assessment are the following:
* It helps in ranking the importance of contributions to overall risk.
* It helps to identify risks that are easily reduced or eliminated.
* It helps to clarify what is known and what is not known about waste sites.
* It can provide an objective basis for decisions on controlling risks, especially for workers employed in the remediation effort.
* It can provide important quantitative information as input to decisions for allocating resources to remediate sites.
* It makes it possible to rank remediation alternatives in terms of risk to workers, the environment, and the public.

### Who?

* Team who knows specific areas of the business.
* Roles:
    * Information Security
    * Management and Users
    * Information Technology

Risk Assessment difficulty: estimating and predicting.
