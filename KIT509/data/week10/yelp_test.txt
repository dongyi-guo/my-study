Spend your money and time some place else it sucks.
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad, below standards.
the presentation of the food was awful very bad.
I can't tell you how disappointed I was I hate this place.
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
Appetite instantly gone food was too dry.
I had a wonderful experience my new go to place for sushi
The whole experience was underwhelming and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time, never coming back.
Best restaurant ever.
Then as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check terrible experience.
The service was good but food was so so.
