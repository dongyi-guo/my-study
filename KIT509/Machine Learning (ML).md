Definition: A computer program said to learn from **Past Experience E** with respect to:
* some class of **Tasks / Goals T** of the learning knowledge
* **Measured Performance P** of the learned knowledge,
If the computer program's **performance at T, measured by P, improves with E**, then, it is a ML programme. Because it is **Learning Knowledge from Past Experience Data in order to accomplish the specific goal**.
## Knowledge Discovery
* Setting the Goal
* Decision Making with learned knowledge
* Machine Learning will use Past Experience Data (Training Data) to find Knowledge (Pattern)
* Example:
	* Autonomous Car
	* Recommender System
	* Stock Prediction
	* Face Recognition
	* Speech Recognition
### Process
**Raw Data -- Data Selection -> Target Data -- Data Pre-processing -> Preprocessed Data -- Data Transformation -> Transformed Data -- Data Mining -> Pattern -- Pattern Evaluation -> Knowledge**
1. Data Selection: Only select the useful data
2. Data Preprocessing: 
	1. Cleaning of incorrect data
	2. Treatment of missing data
	3. Creation of new attributes (where necessary)
## ML Techniques
### Supervised Learning
- Problems where the available data consists of **labelled** examples.
- Classification and Forecasting
- Regression
### Unsupervised Learning
* Learns pattern from **untagged** data, exhibiting self organisation that captures patterns.
* Clustering
* Association
