# IT Evaluation

## Where should I evaluate?

### Before Rollout
* Development phase
* Use cases
* Co-design
* Mainly Qualitative

### After Rollout
* Use phase
* Change management
* User training
* Mainly Quantitative

## User Experience (UX)

* Key example to demonstrate on how we can evaluate
	* The software
	* Websites
	* Devices
* User involved
* Interacting with a product, system or anything related to a interface
* UX is of interest, observable or measurable

### Usability
* Easy to use
* Can be defined a number of ways
* How effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily a user can interact with a user interface

### UX Metrics
* Metric is a way of measuring or evaluating a particular phenomenon or thing that is quantifiable such as distance(longer), height(taller), or speed(faster)
* Metris vary between industries: car (e.g. horsepower petrol consumption), IT industry (e.g. processor speed, memory size, life of a laptop battery), and education (e.g. grades , technical skills)
* UX metric is related to:
  * People and their behavior and attitudes (such as user satisfaction, usefulness, and ease of use);
  * Task success (such as effectiveness and efficiency);
  * Confidence intervals (variability in the data);
  * Relevancy
  
* UX Metrics is to help the organizations to understand the performance of their products
* They have to answer questions such as
	* Will the user recommend the product
	* Is this new product more efficient to use than the current product
	* How does the user experience of this product compare to the competition
	* Do the users feel good about the product or themselves after using it
	* What are the most significant usability problems with this product
  * Are improvements being made from one design iteration to the next
* **UX Metrics can be conducted using observation, quantitative survey, eye tracking (experiment) and qualitative survey.**

### Value of UX Metrics
* They offer a way to estimate the number of users likely to experience the problem
* Calculating ROI - revenue of increment
* Justify your numbers using statistics
* Helping you on getting new insights and lead towards a better understanding of user behaviour
* Helping on revealing patterns (which is not easy)
* Need evidences to support our argument

### **Neilsens' 10 Usability Heuristics**

* Visibility of system status
	* System should always keep users informed with what's going on and the appropriate feedback should be on a reasonable time
* Match between system and the real world
	* The system should speak the users' lang, with words, phrases and concepts that are familiar to the users, follow real world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
* User control and freedom
	* User often picks the functions by mistake and they will need a emergency exit to leave: undo and redo
* Consistency and standards
	* Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions
* Error prevention
	* Prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them in order to present users a confirmation option before they commit to the action
* Recognition rather than recall
	* Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions and options visible. Users should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for system use should be visible or retrievable whenever appropriate
* Flexibility and efficiency of use
	* Accelerators - unseen by the novice user - may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users and allow the users to tailor frequent actions.
* Aesthetic and minimalist design
	* Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility
* Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
	* Error messages should be expressed in plain lang without codes, precisely indicate the problem and constructively suggest a solution.
* Help and documentation
	* Better if the system can be used without documentation, but may need to provide help and documentation. Should be easy to search, task focused, list concrete steps,  minimalist.

### The new Realities

* Augmented reality (AR) is the technology incorporates real-time inputs from real world and create outputs that combines both real-world data and some programmed, interactive elements which operate on those real-world inputs
* AR must:
	* Respond contextually to new external information and account for changes to users' environments
	* Interpret gestures and actions in real-time, with minimal to no explicit commands from users
	* Be presented in a way that does no restrict users' movements in their environment
* As a type of non-command UI, AR interfaces provide excellent opportunities for improving UX
* AR can help the UX in 3 possible fundamental ways:
	* By decreasing the interaction cost to perform a task
	* By reducing the user's cognitive load
* By combining multiple sources of information and minimizing attention switches

### Remark
* Even super well established system can have usability and UX issues
* New tech offers both opportunities to improve UX and has pitfalls to avoid in supporting virtual care

Statistics: Collection of numeric data, text or other media
Independent variables: you want to manipulate or control
Dependent variables: you want to measure

## Type of data:
* Nominal (Categorical) data
	* Are unordered groups or categories, but all you can say they are different, e.g. apples and oranges
		* In UX, nominal data can be Windows v.s. Macs
* Ordinal data 
	* Are ordered groups or categories, data organised in certain way
		* In UX, website can be rated to be excellent, good, fair, poor or very poor
* Interval data
	* Re continuous data where differences between the values are meaningful, but there is no natural zero point
		* In UX, System Usability Scale (SUS) has a series of questions on an overall usability of any syste4 with scores range from 0 to 100 or a Likert from 1 to 7
* Ratio data
 	* Same as interval data but with addition of an absolute 0
  		* In UX, examples include age, height and weight
    
### How to measure the data:
* Descriptive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation and the concept of confidence intervals
* Statistical tests: for comparing means and analysing relationships between variables.
	* If comparing from different users -> independent samples
  	* If same group of users -> paired samples
 
Correlation: relationship between 2 variables -> R-Square value
Nonparametric Tests: for nominal and ordinal data -> x2 (chi square)
Graphs: Col bar Line Scatter Pie Stacked
