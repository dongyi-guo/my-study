**1. Remember â€“ From memory and in your own words describe what Personas are.**

Personas are the profiles of the target users, it is the representation and combination of them who share the same needs, goals, desires and psychological, behavioral and demographical characteristics. It helps the system to succeed as it is the direct study to the most important party of it: user.

**2. Understand: Describe the purpose of a persona with regards to technology design.**

Personas are the targeted users of the system, creating and evaluating personas will make the designers study on people's attribute from a PACT methodologies / frameworks so the technology design can fit in their ways including physical and psychological characteristics, goals and preferences and technology acceptance. One example would be even voice control is a fascinating technology but it should be derived out from the system if the system is designed for users who operate in a quite area or who don't want to share the whole room about their activity.

**3. Apply: Read the following Tutorial Case study, and undertake some independent research to better understand recreational fishers and the context and problems associated with recreational fishing.**

Recreational fishers come to it for leisure and they may differ enormously on biological and technical backgrounds. The system should be able to provide complex and professional knowledge on biological, economical and sustainable-environmental areas but in a non-tech-savvy, intuitive and does not interfere the purpose of users to recreational fishing - having a good life and chill, or enjoying some competition if they want to. By tackling this into consideration, our project could be a better practical if graphical / vision guidance takes the main part of this, like a 2D game. It would also be better if this runs on mobile for more accessibility and casualty, and works off-line as our users will be on boat without Internet connection.

Being a recreational fisher in Tasmania requires you a license which includes learning about fish species being a responsible fisher which indicates some points about fishing with environmental care, and rules, restrictions of area and polices apply. This is delivered via web page in a documented way, our system should try to avoid being implemented in the same way as people will get bored or repeat information from here as recreational fishers have most likely gone through this before. The system can make add-ons to those information and it should try to approach the goal with exploration from other areas, such as global economy impacts.
