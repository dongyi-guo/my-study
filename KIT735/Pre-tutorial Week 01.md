**1. Remember - In your own words, define the terms ‘User Interface’, ‘Human-Computer Interaction’, ‘Interaction Design’ and ‘User Experience’.**

**User Interface**: User Interface is the combination of hardware and software of a computer system that produces a visible, audible and controllable layer that can provide information to the user and collect inputs from the user.

**Human-Computer Interaction**: Human-Computer Interaction is a cross-disciplinary field of study focusing on designing a computer system and utilizing technologies, and human factoring engineering to influence on the interactions between a human user and computer. It is about theory, design, implementation and evaluation of the interaction process. It studies on all 3 aspects of an interaction: the user, the computer (including the User Interface above) and the communication in between.

**Interaction Design**: Interaction Design is a technique or a process of creating and enhancing solutions of communication and interaction involving human. It's wider than Human-Computer Interaction as it steps in researches, studies, theories and practices to effect for all manner of technologies, systems and products. If we say Human-Computer Interaction is to deliver the right thing, Interaction Design is to ensure that how we can deliver the right thing.

**User Experiences**: User Experiences are the measurement of satisfactory of a user to an interaction with a computer, it includes the satisfaction on their goal, pleasure and desire of being involved within such interaction.

**2. Understand - In your own words, describe the core differences between these concepts**

* Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) includes 3 elements: User, Computer, and the Communication in between. It combines with human factors engineering to manifest in the area of Interaction Design.
* User Interface is "what is happening on the screen", it manifests for the "Computer" section of HCI. UI and HCI combines to manifest in the area of Interaction Design.
* User Experiences is "what is happening in front of the screen", it manifests for the "User" section of HCI. It is one of many factors and HCI and ID focusing on but also an outcome of both areas.
* Interaction Design is the daemon process of creating effective solutions of having HCI/UI to provide better UX while taking UX into consideration while implementing.

(Some of the differences are introduced in Question 1)

**3. Apply - What kinds of systems do you like to develop?  Which of HCI/ID/or UX are you most likely to need to know more about?**

For now they would be some CLI programs, native desktop GUI programs and interactive desktop web apps.

As the systems I am interested in to develop are all desktop systems that are meant to be used by users who have a clear purpose (Effectively gather information and perform a function). HCI - Information Structure should be my main focus as it represents the utility of a system, which is the outstanding criteria my systems need to fill.

**4. Analyse - Select an HCI/ID-related conference, and categorize the main themes that are described in their call for papers. What disciplines seem to play a part in these themes?**

For the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), submissions of papers, researches and studies are required highly focusing on the User Interface or the "Computer" section of a Human-Computer Interaction, it diversely includes graphical/web interfaces (interface design), tangible and ubiquitous computing, media and IO (usability design), virtual/augment reality and AI (visual design/invention design), which are methods taken from the computer side in a human-computer interaction.

**5. Evaluate - Identify a technical system that you interact with daily. Evaluate what you like about its design, and what you do not.**

System: MyLO.  

Likes:

* The UI elements of MyLO are margined far away from each other, which makes dividing sections of the webpage easy.
* The contrast between light grey elements/backgrounds and white elements/backgrounds are comfortable to eyes.
* The navigation bar is designed to be very useful and convenient to use.

Dislikes:

* Because of the roomy view, having unnecessary elements on the webpage deals a huge damage. MyLO's homepage has some useless elements, especially the carousel. Combined with the fact that students use MyLO for non-casual tasks, the wasting effort of scrolling through these useless elements accumulates and becomes indeed annoying.
* Because the same reason, the mobile view of MyLO is so bad as well. It requires miserable amount effort of scrolling to locate the elements that user needs.
