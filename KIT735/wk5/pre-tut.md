**1. Remember â€“ From memory and in your own words describe the importance of understanding the context of where and when activities are undertaken by users.**

Knowing the context of where and when activities are undertaken by users unlocks our potentials to design with putting our user's physical, social and organizational conditions, demands and biases into consideration. This provides user easy access and usability to our system, builds up a supportive environment while they are intending to use our system and support their work.

**2. Understand: Describe the three types of contexts to consider when making design decisions, and why each is important in a user-centric design process.**

1. Physical Contexts: Physical contexts are attributes that could effectively reflect on our system's usability to our users, for instance there might be users with vision and hearing impairment, while the design is being processed it will require us to think whether this system is ready for users like them or not and integrate related functions into them.
2. Social Contexts: Social contexts take user's relationships with others into consideration and often it reflects how our system is designed to aid this relationship by providing a environmental support. For example, if a system is trying to serve an audience with Indian cultural background, related languages and words encoding should be found and available, and easy to access the setting for users who are Indian.
3. Organizational Contexts: Organizational contexts are all about work, user might not volunteer to use our system and users put in this kind of context will seek efficiency of communicating with technology and trying to achieve the goals they want to head on. This will effect on our user-centric design process by making designing a system with less distraction, responding time and can be provided to serve as quickly as possible. 

**3. Apply: Read the following Tutorial Case study, and do some independent research to identify the kinds of contexts that recreational anglers would likely find themselves in when they were about to use your new system.**

* Physical
    * On the boat.
    * Doing for license.
* Social
    * Has a community.
    * Intend to gather with family.
    * Intend to gather with friends.
    * Intend to meet more people.

    * Tassie Gov encourages sustainable fishing.
    * It's a trending topic for users.
    * Users got heavily impacted because of this.
