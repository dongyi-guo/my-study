**1. Remember â€“ In your own words describe the difference between Universal Design and Inclusive Design.**

Universal Design and Inclusive Design are like "Top-Down" and "Button-Up" brothers but in design area.

**Universal Design** starts by trying to accommodate the most general group people, it tries to be the mainstream or average that does not odd out to be accessible and useful for as board of people as possible. If the design of the system is intended for some users has special use cases, the incremental of accessibility functions should be added into the current design.

**Inclusive Design** on the other hand, starts with a mind by caring only a very specific group of people with very specific needs, and it only starts by serving this needs at its best. Thing is, there are chances that products started with inclusive design can find other usages in some other use cases that is not in its initial targeted use cases. (Bone Conduct Headphones)

**2. Understand: Describe why these two philosophies are important to ICT design and how they promote technology acceptance.**

This two design philosophies are in important to ICT design is no matter what ICT systems are, it is always essential to have decent interactive design that can lure user in, become useful to user and easy to use for user, and finally engage the user to use more, hence the system has meanings and purpose. TL:DR is it's because HCI and UX matters for ICT system, and universal design and inclusive design contributes to a butter ID or UCD.

Universal design itself is trying to adapt as many and board people as possible at the very start, it considers how as many people as possible can adapt the technology already. Inclusive design on the other hand, is straight up trying to conquer the technology barriers for specific group of people to deliver some services that could not be provided in a product that is universal designed. They themselves are literally the representation or implementation of  building technology acceptance.

**3. Apply: Read the following Tutorial Case study, and refer to your high fidelity prototype. Review the design against the principles of universal and inclusive design. Consider whether anyone with accessibility issues might be limited in their capacity to use your system.**

* Illiteracy: Users will not be able to re ad and follow any instructions.
* ~~Visual impairments: User will not be able interact with the system at all.~~
  * This is wrong, imagine a recreational fisher having visual impairments? No, they are the niche of niche users that you just want to give up on if you are using the inclusive design. 
* Non-English speakers: System does not support any other languages expect English, for non-English speakers it is literally no use.
* With less cognitive loads or easily distracted: it will limit them and discourage them to use our system.
  * For example, I just want to get my fishing license, why there are events, social  functions and so many non-sense here?
