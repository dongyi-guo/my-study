# Fundamentals of HCI

## Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

Three elements:
* User
* Computer
* The way they work together

Is a multi-disciplinary field of study on 
* the design of computer technology 
* the interaction between human and computer
    * theory, design, implementation and evaluation.
* Embrace cognitive science and human factors engineering.

### Interaction v.s. Interfaces

* Interaction is the way / method in the middle, and it concerns all 3 elements.
* Interface is the h/w and s/w, so only the "computer".

### Interaction Design (ID)

* Creating imaginative and attractive solutions.
* Behaviors, animations, sounds.
* Discipline starts with the needs of people.
* Support the way people communicate and interact.
* Enhance their augment.

5 Characteristics:
* Change Solutions.
* Explore possible futures.
* Frame the problem while creating solutions.
* Think through sketching and tangible solutions.
* Instrumental, technical, aesthetical and ethical aspects.

Aim: reduces the negative aspects of the user experiences.

Easy, effective and pleasurable to use.

### ID v.s. HCI

It's the scope.

ID is more wider, it steps in researches, studies, theories and practices to effect on UX for all manner of technologies, systems and products.

HCI is narrower and focuses on individual cases.

HCI is delivering the right thing, ID is like training so we can deliver the right thing.

### User Experience Design (UX/UXD)

UI is what happened on the screen, UX is what happened in front of the screen.

Functional Completion + Usability + Appeal of Interactive artefact  + Integration of Lifestyle

# Summary

HCI is the Utility.

* Is it useful? Does it serve the needs?

ID is the Usability.

* Is it easy or intuitive to use? Does the user like it and want more?
* Minimum Requirements.

UX is the desirability.

* Fill the need, create new demand.
