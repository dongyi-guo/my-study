**1. Remember â€“ From memory, write down the names of the core models focusing on Technology Acceptance, as described in the Lecture.**

Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) is a model for the prediction of behavioral intentions and/or behavior based on attitude and subjective norms.

Theory of Planned Behavior is an extension of TRA, it includes perceived behavioral control as antecedent to behavioral intentions on top of TRA.

Theory of Acceptance Model (TAM) is another extension of TRA, it transfers the attitude factor into perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. TAM has a version 2 and 3, respectively making add-on factors to perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

Diffusion of Innovations Theory is a theory that studies why technology acceptance can be effected by people's Adopter Characteristics, which indicates how timely people are willing to adopt to a new technology.

Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) focuses on explaining the reasons behind a user's behavior intention.

Compute Self Efficacy Theory studies on fields that can contribute to user's confidence of handling the technology, which promotes user to gain more intention to use the system.

**2. Understand: Define, in your own words, the following terms: 'User Interface', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Interaction Design' and 'User Experience'.**

(This question is exactly the same as Question 1 from Pre-tutorial Preparation Week 1, which is submitted before.)

**User Interface**: User Interface is the combination of hardware and software of a computer system that produces a visible, audible and controllable layer that can provide information to the user and collect inputs from the user.

**Human-Computer Interaction**: Human-Computer Interaction is a cross-disciplinary field of study focusing on designing a computer system and utilizing technologies, and human factoring engineering to influence on the interactions between a human user and computer. It is about theory, design, implementation and evaluation of the interaction process. It studies on all 3 aspects of an interaction: the user, the computer (including the User Interface above) and the communication in between.

**Interaction Design**: Interaction Design is a technique or a process of creating and enhancing solutions of communication and interaction involving human. It's wider than Human-Computer Interaction as it steps in researches, studies, theories and practices to effect for all manner of technologies, systems and products. If we say Human-Computer Interaction is to deliver the right thing, Interaction Design is to ensure that how we can deliver the right thing.

**User Experiences**: User Experiences are the measurement of satisfactory of a user to an interaction with a computer, it includes the satisfaction on their goal, pleasure and desire of being involved within such interaction.

**3. Apply: Compile a list of the variables from these models. For each variable, provide a brief explanation in your own words and describe how it could be applied to inform design decisions.**

For Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA): 

* Attitudes
* Subjective Norms
* Behavioral Intention
* Behavior

For  Theory of Planned Behavior:

* Attitudes
* Subjective Norms
* Perceived Behavioral Control
* Behavioral Intention
* Behavior

For Theory of Acceptance Model (TAM):

* External Variables
* Perceived Usefulness
* Perceived Ease of Use
* Attitude towards Using
* Behavioral Intention of Use
* Actual System Use

For TAM 2, factors are added to Perceived Usefulness:

* Subjective Norm
* Image
* job Relevance
* Output Quality
* Result Demonstrability 

For TAM 3, factors are added to Perceived Ease of Use:

* Computer Self Efficacy
* Perception of External Control
* Computer Anxiety
* Computer Playfulness
* Perceived Enjoyment
* Objective Usability

Diffusion of Innovations Theory studies based on user's Adopter Characteristics, which includes:

* Innovators
* Early Adopters
* Early Majority
* Late Majority
* Laggards

For Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), there are:

* Performance Expectancy
* Effort Expectancy
* Social Influence
* Facilitating Conditions
* Gender
* Age
* Experience
* Voluntariness of Use
* Behavioral Intention
* Use Behavior

Compute Self Efficacy Theory studies on factors:

* Encouragement by Others
* Others' use
* Support
* Affect
* Anxiety
* Computer Self Efficacy
* Outcome Expectations

**4. Analyse: Choose a technology you frequently use. Evaluate its characteristics in relation to how well it aligns with the variables described in the provided models, in the context of your own personal characteristics.**

I am using a BOSE QC 45 noise canceling headset, which will be the example of technology here (Bluetooth/Wired Noise Canceling headset).

For Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory of Planned Behavior and Theory of Acceptance Model (TAM):

* Attitude-wise, I am really happy to have a headset, which keeps me warm during Tasmanian winter, and I am bald, having a headset makes me cooler.
* Subjective Norms-wise, BOSE headsets are famous back when I did Bachelor degree at University of Sydney, almost everyone has one due to the amazing noise canceling.
* Perceived Usefulness - Output Quality-wise, it performs so amazing, it has 2 modes - Quiet and Aware:
  * With Quiet mode, there could be a train horning behind me, and I will hear nothing.
  * With Aware mode, I can hear everything and my music is like part of the environmental background.
* Perceived Ease of Use - Perceived Enjoyment, QC 45 uses actual buttons to control modes, volumes and play/pause, which is very intuitive and provide possibilities of blind control.

Together, they made me to not only purchase the device, but adopt and love everything about this product and any technology comes with it, which makes me interact with it.

For Diffusion of Innovations Theory, noise canceling technology has been around for so long, so even the laggards should be able to adopt it fine.

For Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT):

* For Performance Expectancy, it is similar to the Perceived Usefulness mentioned before in TRA.
* For Social Influence, it is similar to the Subjective Norms mentioned before in TRA.
* For Experience, I am a student, being able to create a noise-less environment at any time is a huge demand for me.

For Compute Self Efficacy Theory:

* For Outcome Expectations, it is met by it's outstanding performance mentioned in the TRA.
* For Usage, it is mentioned in the Experience mentioned in UTAUT.
