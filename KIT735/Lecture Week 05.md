# PACT- Context and Technologies, and Data Gathering

## PACT - The "C" - Context

### Three types of contexts

**Organisational**

* Structures and hierarchies, and power relationships and history all impact how a system can be designed to fulfil its task.

**Social**

* A supportive environment, offering plenty of help for the activity, such as training manuals, tuition or access to experts.
* There may be privacy.
* Social norms may dictate the acceptability of certain designs.

**Physical**

* Environment may be Noisy, Cold, Wet, Dirty.
* Important to know

Example of Contexts: "Withdraw cash for ATM"

* Physical context: location of the device, effect of sunshine on the display, security considerations.
* Social contexts: time spent, need of queue.
* Organisational context: how bank works, what are customers to the bank.

### Examples:

Physical Environment:

* Environment: Where technology will be used, dusty or wet environment will need waterproof and dustproof design.
* Ergonomics: Consider the physical ergonomics of its use, size, weight, location and controls for different body types and abilities.
* Lighting: Outdoor usages could be effected by sunshine.
* Noise: Level of noise, noise-cancelling could be preferred.
* Temperature: Device works with extreme high and low temperatures may need to be designed with materials that can withstand these conditions.
* Mobility: If device needs to be carried out and if yes, the comfort and secure when carrying.
* Accessibility:  size, location and size of button, size of fonts, colour and other visual impacts.
* Connectivity: Operated offline if internet can be limited.
* Vibration: Level of vibration. device with machinery may need to withstand vibration and shock.
* Security: Risks and threats presented to the environment where the technology will be used should be considered. If technology used in public space, it may need to have security features like password or other encryption to protect user data.
* Size and Portability: In relation to the environment, device used in a small space may need to be compact, if the device should be used in fieldwork may need to be portable and easy to transport.
* Durability: if device is used in harsh and rugged environment it needs to be impact-resistant and withstand exposures like water, dust or so on.

Social context:

* Cultural norms and Values: of target audience - a dating app should be more discreet and private, instead of being community focused.
* Gender and Identity: Inclusive.
* Accessibility: Inclusive for people with disabilities, such as visual impairment or mobility issues.
* Privacy and Security: Consider implications and ensure the user's data is protected.
* Economic factors: Aware the economic factors, expensive product / service can really be limiting to low-income potential users.
* Social and Environmental Impact: Aware  of the social and environmental impact of the technology and consider ways to minimise any negative effects.
* Legal and Regulatory Frameworks: Aware of the legal and regulatory frameworks that apply to their technology, such as data protection and consumer protection laws.
* Language and Communication: Consider language and communication barriers that impact the usability, including multi-lingual support or creating user-friendly interfaces with limited literacy skills.
* Ethical Considerations: Consider potential biases or unintended consequences, assign the technology with ethical principles and values.
* Social and Economic Inequality: Aware of social and economic inequalities that may impact the adoption and use of the technology. High-tech product for a specific demographic may perpetuate existing inequalities and limit the technology's reach.
* Cultural Diversity:  Aware the cultural diversity of their target audience and ensure that technology is inclusive and respectful of diverse cultural practices and beliefs.
* Human interaction and Connection: Create technologies that promote positive social connections and relationships.
* Power dynamics: Potential misuse and abuse of power, designers should ensure that technology does not perpetuate or reinforce power imbalances.

Organisational Context:

* Organisational Structure: Understand company's organisational structure so the technology can fit into the existing workflow.
* Organisational Culture:  It refers to values, beliefs, and behaviours that are shared by members of an organisation. Understanding them helps designers create technologies that aligned with the values and expectations of the organisation.
* Workflows and Processes: Understanding them helps designers create technologies that fit seamlessly into the existing processes rather than disrupting them.
* Communication Channels: Knowing how information flows with in the organisation helps designers create technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration among team members.
* Stakeholder Interests: Identify the interests and motivations of different stakeholders, this helps designers create technologies that actually meet their needs.
* Technical Infrastructure: Understanding this helps designers to create technologies that comply with relevant laws and regulations.
* Regulatory and Legal Environment: Understanding them helps designers create technologies that comply with relevant laws and regulations.
* Budget and Resources: Knowing the budget and resources available for technology development can help designers create technologies that are cost-effective and that can be implemented within the available resources.
* User Roles and Responsibilities: Understanding them of who will be using the technology can help designers create user interfaces and experiences that are tailored to their specific needs and tasks.
* Training and Support: Knowing the training and support resources available to users that can help designers create technologies that are easy to learn and use, and that come with appropriate documentation and help resources.
* Performance Metrics: Understanding how the organisations measures success helps designers create technologies that align with the organisation's goals and that can be evaluated based on relevant performance metrics.
* Change Management: Knowing how changes are managed can help designers create technologies that can be successfully implemented and adopted by the organisation, including understanding how the organisation manage resistance to change and how to create a positive user experience during the transition to the new technology. 
* Security and Privacy: Understanding the policies helps designers create technologies that protect sensitive information and comply with relevant regulations.
* Geographic and Cultural Factors: Understanding such factors / context makes the product culturally sensitive and meet the needs of users in different regions.
* Industry-specific Factors: Different industries have unique needs and regulations that designers should be aware of when creating technologies. For example, healthcare organisations have strict privacy regulations that must be considered.

## PACT - The "T" - Technologies

Medium that interactive designers work with, consisting h/w and s/w components that communicate with one another and transform some input data into some output data. Designers need to understand the materials that they are working with, input, output, and communication.

## Consolidating PACT 

Basically putting all PACT together, you do this by:

* Jointing P, A, C, and T and every element of them together.
* Use narrative paragraph.

## Data Gathering Post-PACT

Understand:

* What people do
* Might want to do
* Any problems they are having

Requirements:

* Ensures the requirements are there to make system useful and easy to use.
* Something product must do.
* Quality product must have.
* Collecting and collating requirements can be called:
    * Requirements engineering
    * Elicitation
    * Gathering
    * Generation
    * Understanding
* Types:
    * Functional
        * What system must do
        * Linked to usefulness
        * To use
    * Non-functional
        * What system must have
        * Linked to usability
        * To use nicely
* Moscow Rules:
    * Must have - Fundamentals
    * Should have - Essentials
    * Could have - Less important
    * Want to have - Don't have things around yet

## How to understand

Designers are not target audiences, the requirements are not designer's ideas, so you must engage users, and users are not same.

How to gather requirements:

* Interviews
    * Unstructured
    * Semi-structured
    * Structured
    * Prepare, deliver, analyse
* Questionnaires
    * Don't directly access to users.
    * Distribute to your targets.
    * Make sure things are understandable and unambiguous
    * Can collect data that can be analysed.
* Observation
    * Activities.
    * How we work and what we do is difficult to describe.
    * Types:
        * Complete Observer
        * Complete Participant
        * Observer as Participant
        * Participant as Observer
    * The Hawthorne Effect - Individuals modify an aspect of activity of their behaviours while knowing being observed.
    * Ethics and Access.
* Document Analysis
    * Supplementary source.

Considerations:

* Setting goals
* Identifying participants
* Relationships with participants
* Triangulation
* Pilot studies
* Data recording
