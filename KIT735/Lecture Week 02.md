# Technology Acceptance

Definition: User's willingness to employ technology for the task it is designed to support.

## Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA)

It is a Model of Predicting Behavioral Intentions and/or Behavior:

* Attitudes + Subjective Norms (Other people are doing it) ->
    * Behavioral Intention ->
        * Behavior

### Theory of Planned Behavior:

* An extension of TRA.
* Consider Perceived Behavioral Control as antecedent to behavioral intentions
* Attitude + Subjective Norm + Perceived Behavioral Control (User feels confident) ->
    * Intention
        * Behavior

### Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)

Replaces "Attitude" with "ease-of-use" and "usefulness"

* External Variables -> Perceived Usefulness and Ease of Use

* Perceived Ease of Use -> Perceived Usefulness
    * They both -> Attitude toward using
    * Usefulness + Attitude -> Behavioral Intention of Use
    * Actual System Use

Why Perceived?

Because it's what the user is thinking, not what are you thinking.

#### TAM 2, 3...

TAM 2 includes external social factors that effect on behavioral intention to use new tech, we have perceived 0

* Subjective Norm -> Perceived Usefulness:
    * Image
    * Job Relevance
    * Output Quality
    * Result Demonstrability

* Perceived Ease of Use:
    * Computer Self Efficiency
    * Perception of External Control
    * Computer Anxiety
    * Computer Playfulness
    * Perceived Enjoyment
    * Objective Usability

## Innovation Theory

Seeks to explain how, why and at what rate new ideas and technology spread.

Innovators: who want to be the first to try innovations.

## Adopter Characteristics

Early adaptors: 13.4%
* already aware the need to change
* No need to convince

Early Majority: 34%
* Need evidences
* Use stories on them

Late Majority: 34%
* After Majority

Laggards: 16%

## Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)

Things -> Behavioral Intention and Use Behavior
* Performance Expectancy
* Effort Expectancy
* Social Influence
* Facilitating Conditions

and in the middle:
* Gender
* Age
* Experience
* Voluntariness of use

## Computer Self Efficacy Theory

An individual perception of their ability to use technology.

Factors:

* Encouragement by others
* Others' use
* Support
* Affect
* Anxiety
* Computer Self-efficacy
* Outcome expectations
