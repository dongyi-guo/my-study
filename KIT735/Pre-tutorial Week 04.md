**1.Remember â€“ From memory and in your own words describe what Scenarios are.**

Scenarios are essentially what the personas do, they are pieces of narrative texts or stories that describe our persona's activities so evaluation of these activities can be applied, hence describe the persona. They don't have to be personas directly interacting with our systems, they can be any possible activities of them, and scenarios can be conceptual, real-life experiences or observed phenomenons.

**2.Understand: Describe the purpose of a scenario with regards to technology design.**

Scenarios profile our personas, although scenarios are not like use cases that directly tell how personas will interact with our systems, they can reveal lots of common characters of our personas and the system will need to design based on these characters. For example, if a system is targeting a persona that could be quite social and enjoying communication with people, and a possible scenario for this persona could be a very interactive social dinner, the system should be able to not interfere the communication too much or at all during this scenario. Even this could not be actually happening, related features hence should be added to the system.

**3.Apply: Read the following Tutorial Case study, and do some independent research to identify the kinds of activities that recreational anglers would need to undertake to learn about catch sizes and sustainable fishing practices, and the sources of any useful resources for them.**   

This is the exact same topic as last week, so this week, scenarios of recreational anglers will be noted down:

**Possible Scenario 1**: Lisa is a software developer, on weekdays she works quite intensively, resulting she doesn't have any spare time to spend and she doesn't quite get to know people outside from this workplace. On weekends and holidays, Lisa would like to participate some recreational fishing as she gets to know the people from the community and the activity is not fast-paced like what is in her work. Sometimes while she is travelling, resting or even waiting for a fish to be caught, she would like to get some contents so she doesn't get too bored.

**Possible Scenario 2**: Robert is a father of two lovely kids, he loves them unconditionally and he used to his kids all these stories he has ever heard. However, the kids grow up, and Robert doesn't have an endless supply of stories, now the kids just lay on their bed watching YouTube and Twitch videos when they are off school, Robert wants to seek an opportunity to bring the kids outdoor and spend time with them together, he saw a thing called recreational fishing, and he would like to know lots of aspects about this activity.

**Possible Scenario 3**: Ben has been a recreational angler, both casual and competitive for a long time. He used to get all the beautiful fishes he likes and win all the competition. From some point on, he found out it is so hard to get a fish in his usual fishing area, he is quite curious about why.
