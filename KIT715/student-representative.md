**Disclaimer**

This collection of feedback was conducted at the Week 4 tutorial. To engage our peers to provide feedback, 5 questions were pulled up targeting different aspects of this unit. Open-ended questions such as likes/dislikes/suggestions are also pulled up, but as students poured out their thoughts during the closed questions, there is not anything new in the open question section. Hence, all the feedback collected are presented as these 5 question's answers.

Students didn't point any major suggestions or improvements besides the pre-tutorial quiz as they generally are very satisfied for the current state of this unit, but there are some yikes students explicitly mentioned it is definitely better if there could be any chances this requirements are accommodated.

**TL;DR**

Likes:

* The teaching team is the best, love for our tutor and especially the unit coordinator.
* The unit is well-structured and well-paved.
* The content load and progressing are right on the spot.
* The schedule is well-organised, as information of content / assessment is given early, lots of overloading and rushing situations are avoided.
* Students are generally intrigued by the topic / content of the unit, they find this unit fun, and they are certain this unit is going to assist their future career.
* The more standard and theoretical contents are much more welcomed for general students.

Yikes:

* There is limited chance to Dr. David Herbert's teaching session.
* Pre-tutorial Quiz makes it a bit intense (even for last week's tutorial), students are looking forward to have more flexibility to prepare for the quiz more.
* There are students hoping there could be more focus on practical exercises for this unit.

**1. How do you feel about learning in this unit so far? Do you feel overloaded? Comparing to KIT501/726 there are more theoretical contents / assessments in KIT715, are you liking this change or you expect more practical exercise?**

Students in our tutorial are feeling quite fine about the content load and plan, all students in our tutorial have a clear view of what is ahead in this unit's study and assessment. For the theoreticality and practicality, most of the students are more happy about and welcoming the more theory-based studies compared to KIT501/726, while there are some students would miss the practicality in KIT501/726 and wish there could be more contents / assessments on practical activities, such as CTFs or Red Team Blue Team.

Some students promote the idea making the pre-tutorial quiz into an in-tutorial quiz (given password in the tutorial, and finish it anytime during the tutorial) or post-tutorial quiz like KIT501. This will be discussed more in ***Question 3***.

**2. How do you feel about the timeline of this unit? Lots of things are going to happen for KIT715 from week 5 to week 9, do you feel this is going to be a bit rushed on the schedule?**

Students in our tutorial are quite happy about the schedule of the unit as lots of information, materials and specifications about the contents / assessments are released long time before the deadline, which gives enough room for students to work and plan ahead, hence helps students to mitigate the effect of overload and rush. For the lecture / tutorial, students agreed the progress of content push are exactly the right amount and fit into the time, they suggested keeping the momentum.

**3. How do you feel about being supported? This is in terms of teaching stuffs (Unit Coordinator and Tutor), materials (Lecture, Tutorial, and Additional Readings), and infrastructure (LabShare and Network Labs). If you feel there is lacking support what could be improved to better support you?**

Students in our tutorial do feel every staff and every hardware / software equipments are supporting their study with solid quality. Most of the students are familiarised and prepared with the lecture contents before the pre-tutorial quiz, though some students still feel it would be better to make the quiz time more flexible - such as giving the password at start, so they can finish the quiz after finishing the tutorial (Majority of us finish our tutorial content - whether fully or reach assessment point - within 1 hour and 30 minutes), then do some more preparation on slides, and finish it during the tutorial or even post-tutorial like KIT501.

Another matter a student pulled up, and all students agree is it could be way better if we could have more tutorial sessions with Dr. David Herbert, or have a chance to peak into the study of it. Students in our tutorial have intention to study with Dr. Herbert but because of various reasons such as time / class allocation or not realising which tutorial to choose, we lost the chance.

**4. How much do you think you are involved in this unit's study? Does the topic in this unit intrigue you? Do you have motivations such as "This is fun!", "I am going to learn this to find a job" other than "OK I need to graduate". Do you feel engaged by the teaching? If not, what do you think could be there to engage you more in the study?**

All students in our tutorial agree KIT715 is a fun unit, and the content will be ultimately helpful for our cybersecurity career path, it is the truth that majority of us chose cybersecurity as our specialisation because of KIT715 and KIT726.

**5. How do you think this unit's experience can benefit you in your planned future? Whether in terms of the knowledge or study habits.**

All students in our tutorial are confident the content of this unit will help in our future career, it will start us getting familiar with the learning for a cybersecurity position, and we will be able to apply this learnability in future studies and works.

After finishing these 5 pulled-up questions, open-ended questions are asked. As students poured their thoughts during the closed question section, we simply conclude what we have discussed and welcomed our tutor back.
