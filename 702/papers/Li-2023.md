# Li et al., 2023

## Motivation
* ML algorithms are data hungry.
* In reality, data are dispersed over different organisations under privacy restrictions.
* Data privacy increasingly becomes a critical societal concern.
* FL enables the collaborative training of machine learning models among different organisations under privacy restrictions.
* Researches recently started focusing on developing system and infrastructures to ease the development of various FL algorithms.
* Challenges on effectives, efficiency, and privacy.

## Outcomes

* Heterogeneity and autonomy are two important factors to consider when designing a federated learning frameworks.
