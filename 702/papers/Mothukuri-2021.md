## Future Directions in FL security and privacy

* Zero-day adversarial attacks and supporting techniques
  * Potentially advanced deep learning will be a promising solution
* Trusted traceability
  * If a prediction value is changed in the global model, which client will be responsible for this change?
* Well-defined process with APIs
  * Further research needs to be done focusing on enhancing privacy and standardising approaches for each requirement and define a process to implement such enhanced approaches.
* Optimise trade-off between privacy protection enhancement and cost
* Build FL privacy protection enhanced frameworks in practice 
* Client selection and training plan
* Optimisation in different algorithms
* Vision on training strategies and parameters
  * An optimal strategy can help central server to set better trigger points to stop/restart the training rounds. Similar research can be done on different models and domains of the application.
* Better migrating and productionising
