# Gosselin et al., 2022

* Privacy concerns have become a serious issue for companies wishing to protect economic models and comply with end-user expectations.
* Regulations and Laws may impose constraints on data use and protection.
    * This encourages machine learning to evolve from a centralised data and computation approach to a decentralised one.

## Outcomes

* Federated learning, although received growing interests and continuously improvements, stays in its infancy. It has been examined and evaluated by recent studies as a serious alternative to traditional machine learning methods.
* Sufficient progress has not been made concerning understanding FL for its security and privacy risks.
* What federated learning could do more on enhancing the security and privacy part is to integrate principles with other architectures, such as blockchain.
