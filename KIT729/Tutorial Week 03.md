# Task 4: Executive Summary
In this week's tutorial, we discussed potential references we can use in our first assignment, this exploration broadened our eyes and provided us chances to learn there could be many and differently dimensional factors and aspects could be considered while planning a project. We then dived deeper into making a Scoping Management Plan based on what we learned from last week for case study ABCD workout and diet tracking app, setting up goals, objectives, deliverables, scopes and requirements. And finally, we bring this practice to create Work Breakdown Structure, a graphical tree graph mapping tasks, subtasks, and their outcomes.

During this tutorial, we also reviewed ICT governance and its frameworks such as COBIT and ITIL and discussed on practical usage of them on our assignment topic, re-addressing ICT strategies' importance, and connecting to the Scoping Management Plan.
# Task 1: Paper Discussion & Presentation
- **(Chosen)** Rogerson, S., Weckert, J. and Simpson, C. (2000), "An ethical review of information systems development – The Australian Computer Society’s code of ethics and SSADM", Information Technology & People, Vol. 13 No. 2, pp. 121-136. https://doi.org/10.1108/09593840010339853
	- This paper also uses ACS's Code of Ethics and their Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) as the example, the author applies them as example on purpose of addressing the importance of ethical considerations and challenges in IT system development and criticising the lack of them in an IT development scenario. This paper is relevant to our report as not only it uses ACS directly as example, but also ethical issues are still vital today, even after all these years of development in IT industry and 25 years of this paper being published. The rise of Cybersecurity truly proves the demand of ethics built in every IT project's core will be always there.
	- Ideas: Code of Ethics
	- **Feedback: Note this paper is considered to be a bit abstract, still usable but you will want to find papers could be more specific and explanatory as combo.** 
- Holmes, W. (1974). The social implications of the Australian Computer Society (Version 1). University of Tasmania. https://hdl.handle.net/102.100.100/492455
	- This paper directly uses ACS as example, indicating the transition of technical implications to social ones, this could be highly relevant to our report as it supports the development of the app serves a broader audience and fosters community engagement.
	- Ideas: Social Implications
# Task 2: Scope Management Plan
## Scope Statement
### Goals
- Develop the mobile app allowing users to track daily workouts and diet plans.
### Objectives
* An mobile application that will be able to record user's input of daily workouts and diet plans
	* User's manual inputs (numbers & texts)
	* Phone's recording ability (Movement track, Bluetooth, Gyroscope)
	* Exercise gadgets (Sport watch, sports rings)
	* Camera (Food of picture)
* The app can also review workout and diet history
	* Numbers / Records in rows
	* Graphical feedback (Bar / Scatter / Pie plots)
* Account Management
* Continuous Maintenance of the service
* Updates with new feature based on user's feedback.
### Deliverables
- Mobile app with features mentioned in **Objectives**.
- Continuous Maintenance of the service
- User Feedback systems
- Regular Updates with Features 
## Scope Baseline
### Requirements
- Basically the things in **Objectives**.
### Scope
#### In Scope
- Workout Recording
	- Manual Input
	- Automatic Input with mobile devices or gadgets
- Diet Recording
	- Manual Input
	- OCR record of food picture
- Workout History
	- Information Row (Date & Time, Type, Length)
	- Graphical Feedback (Calendar, Bar Chart)
- Diet History
	- Information Row (Food, Calorie, Diet Type like Keto or not)
	- Graphical Feedback (Pie Chart, Scatter Plot)
#### Out of Scope
- Social Activities with other users.
- Body Measurements (Weights)
## Change Control Process
A Change Control Process will be conducted for the project to ensure:
- Efficient Communication
- Avoiding disruption of development progress
- All relevant entities notified
- Non-relevant entities not disturbed
With points above built in mind, a request of change should only will be communicated and assessed with stakeholders who will be interested in this change, but not who will be focusing on it, all higher-level stakeholders supervising the projects as a whole should be notified at all times, and necessary meetings should be held.
## Communication Plan
The communication of this project should include:
- Regular Meetings: Status and Progress Reporting, every 3 days.
- Required Meetings: Call upon required, when change control protocol triggers, or upon higher stakeholder's requests.
- Team meetings: Small Meetings for teams / departments, daily.
- IM Chat: Utilise tools like Slack or Discord, for public information share, Zoom or Phone Call for distant connection. Use as required.
