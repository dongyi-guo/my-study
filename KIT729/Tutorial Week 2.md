	- Information Age
	- Events
		- Networking

	- MACS Uplift
- Member Activities
	- ~~Events Management~~
		- ~~Promotion~~
		- ~~Register and~~ ~~Cancellation~~
	- Certificate Enrolment
As mentioned: "The app will be designed by students for the purpose of providing access to the ACS information and training portal." Since we are building a mobile app, using mobile phone's nature as the most personal electronic device, the app should be focusing on handling user's very personal activities, ~~which means I think a login function should be vital, activities Member Activities should be the main focus, information gathering should be there as that is one of the most important reason people will visit ACS, but they can and it is better to view via Desktop devices.~~
To Be Discussed above.
