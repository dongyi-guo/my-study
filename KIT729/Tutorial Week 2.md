# Task 5: Executive Summary
In this week, we clarified what is a project and what could motivate stakeholders to approve and encourage a project in class. For the rest of the tutorial work, we successfully identified the purpose of the ACS mobile app based on the scenario and requirement given by Dr. Meredith Castles, we then identified scopes, stakeholders, feasibility, possible governance and control measurements, and we came up a typical 6-month project plan. We finally cleared the hardware and software required for ACS to develop such app, and we pursue our recommendations for future updates that will best the value out of this app.

# Class Activities: Why Student-Focused Food delivery App?
- Fellow Students might just want to grab the food before or in between their classes, they don't need dishes are complex, having Entrees, using 100 different utensils, and involving 1000 different table manners. A student-focused food delivery app, instead of being generally accepted by every customers and every situations, like UberEATS, DoorDash, or MenuLog, will be able to tailor who are around campus, having cheap and easy transportations such as bikes and scooters, providing a more economical price for the deliver service, which is the main reason stopping people from ordering food deliveries. This will be considerably helpful and attractive as budget is probably one of the most important factors for a student to consider.
# Task 1
Based on my research, ACS could mainly use this app to supply their services:
- Supplying Information
	- Organisation Information & Devotion
		- Branches
	- News
	- Media Releases
	- Information Age
	- Events
		- Networking
		- Industry Insights Leaders Series
		- ICT Leader Series
		- ICT Educators Series
	- Training & Education
		-  Trained Organisation
		- Accredited Courses
		- ICT Educators
	- Migration Skill Assessment
	- Professional Year Programmes
	- Public Policy Positions
- Training & Professional Development Enrolment
	- Professional Recognition
		- mySFIA tools
	- Trained Certificates and Tools
		- microCredentials
		- ACS Certification
	- Liability Insurance
	- MACS Uplift
As mentioned: "The app will be designed by students for the purpose of providing access to the ACS information and training portal." The app should be mainly focused on providing information to the user. Since we are building a mobile app which is a smartphone's nature to be the most personal electronic device, and the fact that ACS does have services that requires or the membership account (Events, Course, Professional Year, Skill Assessment and Certificate Enrolment Management), the app in the future can be unlocked to focus on these personal activities.
# Task 2
## Scope
### In Scope
* Information Supply
	* Organisational
	* Events
	* Personal Development & Training
	* Accredited Course / Certificate
	* Service / Tools
	* Skill Assessment
	* Professional Year
* Service / Tool Access (mySFIA)
* Link to Enrolment Portal
### Out of Scope
* Accredited Course / Certificate Enrolment
* Tool Functions
* Submission of Skill Assessment
* Booking of Professional Year
* ACS Membership Management
* ACS Account Settings
## Potential Stakeholders
* ACS themselves.
* Australian Federal Government.
* State Governments.
* ACS members.
* ACS partners, such as educators, co-operating companies.
## Feasibility Study
This app could be a great start for whoever hasn't heard of ACS but now needs to get involved, and whoever needs to keep ACS news and information fresh. This operationally increases the business performance since clients are becoming closer, financially increase the revenue. Technically this could be very easily done as ACS already has a website which itself is mobile-friendly enough already, using a cross-platform development stack such as Flutter will tackle the job smoothly.
## Project Plan
As this project is a mobile app, a 6-month timeline will be given for this project with presumably by us 7 stages:
1. Initialisation
	1. Exactly what we are doing here.
	2. Need Scopes, Requirements, Objectives.
	3. Need Stakeholders.
	4. Need confirm on final Deliverables.
	5. Set up sprints for agile, assemble teams.
2. Pre-development Study and Analysis
	1. Meet Stakeholders
	2. Make user's Personas
	3. Hammer down final requirement features, functional and non-functional
	4. Documentation
3. Wireframe or Prototype
	1. Lo-fi Prototypes, following with various design principles
	2. Locate questions via usability testing
	3. Refine the prototype by testing's feedback
4. Development
	1. Arrange jobs in team, documentation
	2. Set up environment, get everyone aligned
	3. CODE
	4. Unit Testing
5. Integration Testing and System Testing
	1. Acceptance Testing
	2. Refine based on feedback
	3. Fix bugs
6. Launch with Support, Feedback, and Maintenance
	1. Regular Updates
	2. Security Audits
	3. Troubleshoot users
	4. Add new features
## Governance and Appropriate Controls
After carful discussion and research, we purpose following governance and controls during the development based on related governance laws, frameworks, and guidances:
1. **Data Privacy and Protection and Access Control**: Privacy Act 1988, Australian Privacy Principles (APP)
	1. User's Data
	2. Partner's Data
	3. Organisational Data
2. **Information Security Management**: ISO 27001
	1. Security Audits, Assessment and Pen Tests
	2. Encryption
	3. MFA
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1
	1. Accessibility Compliance, guided by the mobile system (iOS/Android)
4. **Service Management**: ITIL
	1. Feedback System
	2. Monitor System
5. **Future Maintenance and Update**: ITIL
	1. Bug Fixes
	2. New Features
6. **Risk Management and Control**: COBIT
	1. Incident Management and Recover
## Why Fund this
ACS does have services that require memberships and accounts, their presences can be easily used on a desktop system, but on mobile, simply with a mobile web browser, their exposure does not efficiently spreads there, especially if they have membership, event, and training course certificate progress services which tie to an account, this could unlock the potential for ACS members to stick closer to the organisation, interact more, and generate more revenue due to more business.
# Task 3
## Structure of Hardware / Software Requirements
- 5-7 workstations
	- Intel 11th Gen i5 or higher or AMD Ryzen 5 or higher.
	- 16GB RAM or higher
	- 512GB Storage or higher
	- Cross-Platform Solution: Flutter, with any IDE the devs like, but this one must be the same across the team.
- 3-5 Android Phones
	- Budget
	- Mid-range
	- Flagship
- 2-3 iPhones
	- One old, like iPhone SEs
	- One mid-high or mid-new, like iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16
- Version Control (Git) / Github / Gitlab / Bitbucket / Own Git Server
	- Github / Gitlab are free, if server needed, we can use as our own test server as well, preferably more powerful than m3-large on ARDC. 
- CI/CD
	- Github Actions will do
- Documentation
	- Jira
	- Confluence
	- Obsidian
## What to include
Hopefully, the app in the future will be including ACS member login, membership management, and managing courses, certificates, and more on the app. This unfortunately is out-of-scope by Meredith's requirement.
The most suitable governance in our opinion should be the APP and the ISO 27001, data leaking and its failed protection is unacceptable and unforgivable for entity like ACS, this app should focus on user data security prior to everything else.
# Task 4
## Goals
Given by Dr. Meredith Castles, this app now is used to provide information and training to potential users. Detailed subgoals are **Task 1**.
## Requirements
* People: the dev team should be 5-7 people, no more no less to make the best effort but not wasting money.
* Assets: it's basically hardware and software requirements mentioned in **Task 3** but with office rents and desk & chairs.
* $: Should not be over $20K.
## Stakeholders
Stakeholder information is given in **Task 2**.
## Project Governance
Governance information is given in **Task 2**.
