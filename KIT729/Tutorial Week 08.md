# Task 2
**What first step must XYZ inc. take to promote collaboration among teams to work together to address the organisation's challenges**
XYZ needs to put the data management team and the knowledge management team under the same department and create a unified governance structure, enforcing strong communications, unifying goals, priorities, tasks, requirements, schemas, and strategic alignments with collaborative roles in both teams.
- Define shared goals and priorities
- Establish communication channels
- Align data and knowledge assets with business strategy
- Assign roles and responsibilities for collaborative tasks
This lays the foundation for trust, accountability, and alignment.

**What strategies will you employ for the team to be able to work collaboratively to eliminate:**¬†**(a) duplications of efforts (b)**¬†**improving the effectiveness of data analysis (d) facilitate knowledge sharing.**¬†
-  To eliminate duplication of efforts:
	- **Implement a central metadata repository** to track what data and knowledge assets exist and where
	- Use **master data management (MDM)** to maintain a single version of truth
	- Define **standard naming conventions** and documentation practices
	- Promote transparency in who owns/uses what data or content
- To improve the effectiveness of data analysis: 
	- Ensure analysts and domain experts from both teams **co-design dashboards and reports**
	- Encourage the use of **shared business glossaries** so everyone speaks the same ‚Äúdata language‚Äù
	- Use **collaborative tools** (e.g., shared BI platforms, integrated data catalogs)
	- Train the knowledge team on data literacy and the data team on contextual domain knowledge
- To facilitate knowledge sharing:
	- Deploy a **centralised knowledge management platform** (like Confluence, SharePoint, or Notion)
	- Encourage documentation of data insights, not just reports (i.e., the "why" behind results)
	- Create cross-team **communities of practice** for regular knowledge exchange

**How would you ensure all teams improve their understanding of data and knowledge management¬†practices?**
- **Conduct joint workshops or lunch-and-learns** explaining core concepts from DAMA-DMBOK
- Develop a **shared training program** on both data literacy and knowledge sharing practices
- Assign **‚Äúambassadors‚Äù or ‚Äúchampions‚Äù** in each team who help bridge the knowledge gaps
- Encourage the use of **use-case-driven training**, where real business problems are used to explain DKM practices

**What steps must be taken to develop a shared data and knowledge management platform, and how will the shared system help to improve collaboration between teams?**
Steps to develop a shared data and knowledge management platform:
- **Needs assessment**: Identify the types of data and knowledge each team uses.
- **Platform selection**: Choose a tool that supports structured data (e.g., reports, dashboards) and unstructured knowledge (e.g., documents, FAQs).
- **Data integration**: Use APIs or ETL tools to bring in relevant data sources.
- **Access control & governance**: Define who can view, edit, or contribute what.
- **Training & onboarding**: Make sure all teams know how to use the system effectively.
- **Monitoring & feedback**: Track usage and iterate based on team input.
How could it help:
- **Reduces silos** by giving everyone a single point of access
- **Boosts data reuse and prevents rework**
- **Improves traceability and trust in insights**
- **Supports faster, better-informed decision-making**

**What are the benefits of the collaboration between data management and knowledge management teams?**
- **Unified strategy and decision-making**
- **Reduced redundancies** in tools, data collection, and reporting
- **Improved data quality and accessibility**
- **Faster onboarding** for new employees due to better knowledge documentation
- **Innovation** driven by combining structured data with experiential knowledge
- **Better compliance** and audit readiness by aligning documentation and data governance

# Task 3: Selected Data and Knowledge Management Platforms
### üîπ Knowledge Management Systems
#### 1. Document Management System (DMS) ‚Äî e.g. Microsoft SharePoint
- Centralises file/document storage for ACS staff and stakeholders
- Supports version control, access permissions, and metadata tagging
- Resolves duplication of knowledge and loss of documents in email threads or siloed drives
- Enables knowledge reuse by organising internal policies, reports, event content, etc.
üõ† Use Case for ACS:  
Supports the collaborative content curation of events, project documentation, and strategic knowledge in the Tasmanian ICT Industry Collective Space.
#### 2. Knowledge Base ‚Äî e.g. Atlassian Confluence
- Acts as a structured, searchable repository for best practices, Q&As, and guides
- Encourages contributions from different departments and community members (e.g. students or citizen scientists)
- Supports page templates, tagging, and linking related content
üõ† Use Case for ACS:  
Can be used as a self-service portal for FAQs, project documentation, and onboarding for new members or contributors to the participatory science platform.
#### 3. Collaboration Platform ‚Äî e.g. Microsoft Teams or Slack (with integration to other tools)
- Facilitates cross-department communication and coordination
- Allows chat, video calls, file sharing, threaded discussions
- Integrates with DMS, knowledge base, calendar tools, and task boards
üõ† Use Case for ACS:  
Fosters real-time knowledge sharing and stakeholder engagement across branches and collaborators (e.g., students, educators, industry reps).
### üîπ Data Management Systems
#### 1. Data Warehouse ‚Äî e.g. Snowflake or Amazon Redshift
- Consolidates structured data from different ACS sources (e.g., member database, event participation, survey responses)
- Supports business intelligence tools for reporting and dashboards
- Enables trend analysis, engagement metrics, and stakeholder segmentation
üõ† Use Case for ACS:  
Helps ACS monitor app usage, analyze ICT trends from citizen science inputs, and support decision-making.
#### 2. Data Governance Platform ‚Äî e.g. Collibra or Alation
- Provides data stewardship roles, glossary, policy rules, lineage tracking
- Enforces data quality, access control, and regulatory compliance
- Supports accountability in data ownership across departments
üõ† Use Case for ACS:  
Ensures that shared data (especially from multiple external contributors) is trustworthy, consistent, and governed throughout its lifecycle.
#### 3. NoSQL Database ‚Äî e.g. MongoDB
- Handles unstructured or semi-structured data, like citizen-submitted forms, survey results, user profiles, etc.
- Scales horizontally and offers flexible schema design
- Supports real-time data intake from mobile applications and APIs
üõ† Use Case for ACS:  
Captures large-scale, diverse user-contributed data from the mobile app and citizen science platform.****
