# Self Learning
- **Data**: Numbers without personal relevance.
- **Information**: Relevant data.
- **Knowledge**: Information you can act on.
- **Knowledge Base**: A collection of articles that document experiences.
**Customer services are knowledge keepers.**

**Why article:**
1. Shared expertise is the best
2. Make answer easy.
3. Make answers consistent.
4. Best time to document is when answering questions.

Customer Service Challenges happen, **it could be the reason**:
- Cannot access to the knowledge base - takes long to close tickets.
- Knowledge is not shared clearly and wisely, or shared with issues, like duplicates.
	- Takes long to onboard staff.
	- Customer cannot help themselves.
	- Institutional knowledge is hard to access.

**Problem-Solution**
- We are busy - Refine the jobs.
- We measure the wrong things - Include outcome and self-service data.
- We expect perfection - Aim a sufficient solution.
- We are wordy - Get right to the point.

A **Data Governance Plan** will ensure:
- Policy
- Usability
- Consistency
- Availability
- Integrity
- Security

# Task 2
## People
- **Objective**: Uncover key stakeholders, cultural barriers, and skill gaps impacting KM/data management synergy.
1. **Who are the primary stakeholders (e.g., data stewards, KM leaders, frontline employees) influencing cross-functional collaboration between data and KM systems, and how do their roles, motivations, and power dynamics shape knowledge-sharing behaviours in intercontinental teams?**
    - _Rationale_: Stakeholder roles (e.g., KM leaders, data architects) must align with organisational culture and incentives. For example, resistance often stems from siloed teams fearing loss of control over "their" data 410.
    - _Method_: Use RACI matrices to map roles (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) and identify conflicts.
2. **What cultural barriers (e.g., hierarchical structures, regional communication norms) inhibit knowledge-sharing between data and KM teams, and how can organisational commitment (e.g., trust, transparency) mediate these challenges in a global context?**
    - _Rationale_: Cultural infrastructure (e.g., trust, leadership support) is critical for KM success. For instance, Taiwanese public utilities found that cultural alignment improved knowledge process capabilities 10.
    - _Method_: Conduct cross-regional surveys to assess cultural perceptions of knowledge ownership.
3. **How can competency frameworks (e.g., data literacy, collaborative problem-solving) be designed to upskill employees in both technical (data management) and social (KM sharing) domains, ensuring alignment with organisational learning strategies?**
    - _Rationale_: Training programs must bridge technical skills (e.g., cloud computing) and soft skills (e.g., storytelling for knowledge transfer) 812.
    - _Method_: Leverage gamified learning platforms to incentivise skill adoption.
## Process
- **Objective**: Map processes for harmonising data/KM workflows and governance.
1. **What existing processes (e.g., data governance frameworks, KM review cycles) can be adapted to integrate data management and KM systems, and where are the critical gaps (e.g., redundant approvals, misaligned metrics) causing inefficiencies?**
    - _Rationale_: Process alignment requires auditing existing workflows. For example, NASA’s KM systems streamlined project approvals by integrating risk management protocols 7.
    - _Method_: Use process mining tools to identify bottlenecks in cross-departmental workflows.
2. **How can Agile methodologies (e.g., sprints, retrospectives) be applied to co-develop KM/data policies, ensuring iterative feedback from stakeholders while maintaining compliance with global regulations (e.g., GDPR, APPs)?**
    - _Rationale_: Agile processes enable rapid adaptation to regional regulatory changes. The ACS case study highlights the need for iterative policy design 411.
    - _Method_: Implement biweekly cross-functional workshops to refine governance frameworks.
3. **What governance structures (e.g., centralised vs. federated models) best balance autonomy and standardisation in intercontinental teams, and how do they impact knowledge accessibility and data security?*
    - _Rationale_: Hybrid governance models (e.g., federated with centralised oversight) mitigate risks like data silos while respecting regional autonomy 1011.
    - _Method_: Benchmark governance models from industries like healthcare (e.g., Mayo Clinic’s KM hubs).
## Content / IT
- **Objective**: Ensure IT systems support seamless data/KM integration while mitigating risks.
1. **Which IT infrastructure components (e.g., cloud platforms, APIs) are critical for integrating data warehouses with KM repositories, and how can interoperability challenges (e.g., legacy systems, data formats) be resolved without compromising cybersecurity?**
    - _Rationale_: Cloud computing and APIs enable integration but require robust security. For example, AWS/Azure deployments in the ACS case study prioritised encryption and access controls 58.
    - _Method_: Conduct penetration testing on integrated systems pre-launch.
2. **How can AI-driven content quality tools (e.g., NLP for metadata tagging, predictive analytics) automate the curation of high-value knowledge assets, reducing redundancy and ensuring relevance across diverse user groups?**
    - _Rationale_: AI enhances content discoverability. Optimizely’s KM system uses predictive search to prioritise trending topics 812.
    - _Method_: Deploy NLP algorithms to analyse user search patterns and auto-tag content.
3. **What risk mitigation strategies (e.g., data anonymisation, role-based access) are most effective in balancing knowledge accessibility with compliance in regions with stringent data laws (e.g., EU, China)?**
    - _Rationale_: Anonymisation and granular access controls align with GDPR/APPs. The ACS prioritised anonymising public submissions 1011.
    - _Method_: Implement dynamic data masking tailored to regional regulations.
## Strategy Impact
- **Objective**: Align KM/data synergy with organisational goals and measure ROI.
1. **How can the organisation’s strategic objectives (e.g., market expansion, innovation) be translated into actionable KPIs (e.g., time-to-insight, cross-regional collaboration rates) for the integrated KM/data system?**
    - _Rationale_: KPIs must reflect strategic priorities. Gold et al. (2001) link KM capability metrics to organisational effectiveness 10.
    - _Method_: Develop a balanced scorecard linking KM metrics (e.g., knowledge reuse) to revenue growth.
2. **What is the expected ROI of synergising data and KM systems in terms of operational efficiency (e.g., reduced duplication) and innovation (e.g., patents filed), and how can these outcomes be quantified over a 3–5-year horizon?**
    - _Rationale_: ROI models should capture both tangible (cost savings) and intangible (innovation) benefits. Forrester estimates automated KM systems reduce support costs by 80% 8.
    - _Method_: Use Monte Carlo simulations to project long-term ROI under varying scenarios.
3. **How can the integrated system adapt to shifting strategic priorities (e.g., entering emerging markets) while maintaining alignment with core organisational values (e.g., data ethics, employee empowerment)?**
    - _Rationale_: Adaptive strategies require flexible KM architectures. The "four key KM questions" framework emphasises context-specific knowledge needs 11.
    - _Method_: Establish a strategic review board to reassess alignment quarterly.
