# Task 1: Paper
## Question 1: Objectives
1. To identify and synthesize the characteristic challenges that developing nations face in the successful implementation of ICT projects in government.
2. To propose a descriptive framework for categorizing key factors affecting ICT implementation in government, distinguishing between factors for success (drivers and enablers) and failure (barriers and inhibitors).
3. To suggest actionable strategies for increasing the success of ICT projects in government, particularly in developing countries like Kenya.
## Question 2: Research Questions
1. What critical factors or variables can be identified as important in terms of their effect on ICT project implementation in government?
2. Are there common variables and can the variables be synthesised and categorised under common broad categories for specific action to be taken?
3. Does the resulting analysis of the data lead to a framework that enables analysis and understanding of the ICT implementation experience in Kenya and can it help to identify problems and solutions?
4. Does this in turn result in a framework that can be used to guide ICT implementation in Kenya and other developing countries?
5. Does the resulting framework build on previous frameworks either in terms of its applicability to real life situations, its inclusive nature, its cohesiveness, and its ability to generate questions for further research?
## Question 3: Methodology
1. **Literature Review**: Analysis of case studies from both developed and developing countries, focusing on ICT implementation challenges and success factors.
2. **Preliminary Investigation**: Grounded in the Kenyan e-Government context, using:
    - In-depth interviews.
    - Observations.
    - Documentary reviews.
3. **Framework Development**: A conceptual framework (Figure 1 and Figure 3) is proposed, mapping input variables (success/failure factors) to output variables (organizational/technological benefits).
## Question 4: Findings
1. **Key Factors for Success**:
    - **Drivers**: Vision/strategy, government support, external pressure (e.g., donor funding), rising consumer expectations, and technological modernization.
    - **Enablers**: Effective project management, good practice adoption, and stakeholder involvement.
2. **Key Factors for Failure**:
    - **Barriers**: Poor infrastructure, financial constraints, lack of skilled personnel, bureaucratic leadership, and cultural resistance.
    - **Inhibitors**: Unmet user needs, incompatible technology, lack of ICT policies, and donor-driven (rather than needs-based) projects.
3. **Output Benefits**:
    - **Organizational**: Cost reduction, improved service delivery, transparency, and efficiency.
    - **Technological**: Enhanced communication, large storage capacity, and real-time processing.
4. **Action Plan for Success**:
    - Conduct e-readiness assessments.
    - Develop clear ICT policies and strategies.
    - Adopt modular, incremental designs (design divisibility).
    - Encourage public-private partnerships.
    - Leverage local improvisations to bridge gaps between design and reality.
5. **A  Descriptive Framework and its Applicability**:
    - The proposed framework (Figure 3) categorizes inputs (success/failure factors) and outputs (benefits) to guide tailored solutions for developing countries.
# Task 2
## Task 2a
1. Because the success of an organization depends on the effective implementation of their strategies.
2. From that video:
	- **Aspirational Vision**: Defining how the company can contribute to a more sustainable world.
	- **Value Creation**: Explaining how the transformation creates value for key stakeholders, including employees.
	- **Medium-Term Ambitious Targets**: Setting targets to guide the transformation and drive action.
3. To ensure alignment with an organization's mission, vision, and values:  
	- Define an aspirational vision that aligns with the company's mission and values.
	- Clearly explain how the strategic implementation plan creates value for stakeholders.
	- Set medium-term targets that are consistent with the organization's long-term goals and vision.
