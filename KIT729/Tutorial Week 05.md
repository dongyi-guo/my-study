# Summary

In this week's workshop, we comprehensively went through Assignment 2's specification, requirements, deliverables and other useful components for this assignment, bringing with assignment's scenario and tasks, we dived into the practice of our research skills by reading a paper about implementation plan, which is exactly what we are doing in assignment 2, the urge of finishing tasks and assignments, and the previous assignment spec intro motivated us A LOT while gathering information from this paper. Then we dive into Participatory / Citizen Science, during my meetings, with my tutorial group and assignemnt group, we stumble into different understandings and imaginations of implementing this technique as it seems like Participatory / Citizen Science have different  definitions depending on what company/organisation is defining it, and we want to find previous platforms, but direct results are big and they are behind paywalls, this makes us more curious about it. We will research more on this, see if we can find a sample platform so our suggested one to ACS can learn something, and we will find the most relevant definition and set of characteristics for our assignment's schema.
# Task 1: Paper
## Question 1: Objectives
1. To identify and synthesise the characteristic challenges that developing nations face in the successful implementation of ICT projects in government.
2. To propose a descriptive framework for categorizing key factors affecting ICT implementation in government, distinguishing between factors for success (drivers and enablers) and failure (barriers and inhibitors).
3. To suggest actionable strategies for increasing the success of ICT projects in government, particularly in developing countries like Kenya.
## Question 2: Research Questions
1. What critical factors or variables can be identified as important in terms of their effect on ICT project implementation in government?
2. Are there common variables and can the variables be synthesised and categorised under common broad categories for specific action to be taken?
3. Does the resulting analysis of the data lead to a framework that enables analysis and understanding of the ICT implementation experience in Kenya and can it help to identify problems and solutions?
4. Does this in turn result in a framework that can be used to guide ICT implementation in Kenya and other developing countries?
5. Does the resulting framework build on previous frameworks either in terms of its applicability to real life situations, its inclusive nature, its cohesiveness, and its ability to generate questions for further research?
## Question 3: Methodology
1. **Literature Review**: Analysis of case studies from both developed and developing countries, focusing on ICT implementation challenges and success factors.
2. **Preliminary Investigation**: Grounded in the Kenyan e-Government context, using:
    - In-depth interviews.
    - Observations.
    - Documentary reviews.
3. **Framework Development**: A conceptual framework (Figure 1 and Figure 3) is proposed, mapping input variables (success/failure factors) to output variables (organizational/technological benefits).
## Question 4: Findings
1. **Key Factors for Success**:
    - **Drivers**: Vision/strategy, government support, external pressure (e.g., donor funding), rising consumer expectations, and technological modernisation.
    - **Enablers**: Effective project management, good practice adoption, and stakeholder involvement.
2. **Key Factors for Failure**:
    - **Barriers**: Poor infrastructure, financial constraints, lack of skilled personnel, bureaucratic leadership, and cultural resistance.
    - **Inhibitors**: Unmet user needs, incompatible technology, lack of ICT policies, and donor-driven (rather than needs-based) projects.
3. **Output Benefits**:
    - **Organisational**: Cost reduction, improved service delivery, transparency, and efficiency.
    - **Technological**: Enhanced communication, large storage capacity, and real-time processing.
4. **Action Plan for Success**:
    - Conduct e-readiness assessments.
    - Develop clear ICT policies and strategies.
    - Adopt modular, incremental designs (design divisibility).
    - Encourage public-private partnerships.
    - Leverage local improvisations to bridge gaps between design and reality.
5. **A  Descriptive Framework and its Applicability**:
    - The proposed framework (Figure 3) categorises inputs (success/failure factors) and outputs (benefits) to guide tailored solutions for developing countries.
# Task 2
## Task 2a: Strategic Implementation Plan
##### What is a strategic implementation plan, and why is it important for organisations?
- Because the success of an organisation depends on the effective implementation of their strategies.
##### What are the key components of a strategic implementation plan, and how do they relate to an organisation's overall strategic plan?
- From the video, three components are mentioned:
  1. **Aspirational Vision**: Defining how the company can contribute to a more sustainable world.
  2. **Value Creation**: Explaining how the transformation creates value for key stakeholders, including employees.
  3. **Medium-Term Ambitious Targets**: Setting targets to guide the transformation and drive action.
##### How can an organisation ensure that its strategic implementation plan is aligned with its mission, vision, and values?
- To ensure alignment with an organisation's mission, vision, and values:  
	- Define an aspirational vision that aligns with the company's mission and values.
	- Clearly explain how the strategic implementation plan creates value for stakeholders.
	- Set medium-term targets that are consistent with the organization's long-term goals and vision.
## Task 2b: Who are the stakeholders?
##### Who are the stakeholders that are involved in the implementation plan, and what are their roles and responsibilities?
- Internal Stakeholders:
  - Executives & Leadership Team: Provide strategic direction, approve resources, and oversee progress.
  - Project Managers: Oversee implementation, coordinate teams, and ensure milestones are met.
  - Employees & Operational Teams: Execute the plan, adapt to new processes, and provide feedback.
- External Stakeholders:
  - Customers & Clients: End-users of the planâ€™s outcomes, whose needs must be addressed.
  - Suppliers & Partners: Provide necessary resources, technology, or support.
  - Regulators & Government Bodies: Ensure compliance with laws and industry regulations.
  - Investors & Shareholders: Require transparency on risks and returns.
##### What is the importance of stakeholder engagement in the implementation plan, and how can organisations ensure that stakeholders are effectively engaged?
**Importance:**
- Encourages buy-in and support, reducing resistance.
- Increases collaboration and innovation, improving outcomes.
- Mitigates risks and conflicts by addressing concerns early.
**Ensuring Effective Engagement:**
- Establish clear communication through meetings, reports, and updates.
- Use feedback loops (surveys, workshops) to incorporate stakeholder input.
- Assign stakeholder relationship managers to maintain continuous dialogue.
- Set up advisory committees for high-impact stakeholders.
##### How can organisations identify and prioritize stakeholders for the implementation plan, and what factors should be considered when prioritising them?
Identification Methods:
- **Stakeholder Mapping:** Identify all potential stakeholders.
- **Interest-Influence Matrix:** Categorize stakeholders based on their impact and level of interest.
Prioritization Factors:
- **Influence & Power:** Higher authority or decision-making power = higher priority.
- **Interest & Impact:** Those significantly affected by the implementation must be prioritized.
- **Urgency & Risk Exposure:** Prioritize stakeholders with urgent concerns or high-risk involvement.
##### What are some common challenges that organisations face when engaging with stakeholders during the implementation plan, and how can they overcome these challenges?
* **Resistance to Change:** Address through transparent communication and training.
* **Conflicting Interests:** Align interests by focusing on shared goals and negotiating compromises.
* **Limited Resources for Engagement:** Use digital platforms and automation for scalable communication.
* **Lack of Trust or Misinformation:** Build trust with consistent updates and transparency.
##### How can organisations ensure that the concerns and perspectives of all stakeholders are taken into account during the implementation plan?
* Host multi-stakeholder forums for open discussions.
* Use structured feedback mechanisms (surveys, one-on-one meetings).
* Incorporate stakeholder input into decision-making frameworks.
* Appoint stakeholder representatives to ensure diverse perspectives.
# Task 3

##### What is Citizen Science (CS) and Participatory Science (PS), and how could it benefit organisations such as the Australian Computer Society?
* **Citizen Science (CS)** refers to the involvement of non-professional scientists (e.g., the general public, hobbyists, or students) in scientific research, typically in data collection, analysis, or problem-solving.
* **Participatory Science (PS)** is a broader approach that not only includes data collection but also encourages collaborative decision-making and co-design of research projects with the public or stakeholders.
Benefits to organisations like the Australian Computer Society (ACS):
- **Innovation & Problem-Solving:** Involving diverse participants brings fresh perspectives, potentially leading to creative solutions.
- **Community Engagement & Trust:** Strengthens relationships between organisations and the public by making them active contributors.
- **Scalability of Research:** Crowdsourced participation allows for larger-scale data collection at a fraction of the cost.
- **Better Policy & Ethical Considerations:** Ensures that technology solutions align with public needs and societal concerns.
##### What are the key features of CS and PS systems, and how do they differ from other software applications?
Key Features of CS & PS Systems:
- **Crowdsourcing & Data Collection:** Users contribute data, insights, or solutions (e.g., citizen reports, surveys, images).
- **Collaborative Tools:** Open platforms where users can discuss findings, analyze data, and refine ideas.
- **Gamification & Incentives:** Many systems include rewards, leaderboards, or social recognition to keep participants engaged.
- **Real-Time Feedback & Validation:** Data submitted by participants is often reviewed by experts or AI-driven verification tools.
- **Open Data & Transparency:** Many CS projects provide open-access datasets, allowing anyone to analyze and build upon the results.
How CS & PS Differ from Traditional Software Applications:
- **User-Driven vs. Admin-Driven:** Unlike regular enterprise applications, CS/PS systems rely on public engagement and contributions.
- **Evolving & Adaptive:** CS/PS projects often evolve based on community feedback, while standard applications follow fixed feature roadmaps.
- **Ethical & Community-Focused:** PS systems prioritize accessibility, inclusivity, and ethical considerations more than most commercial software.
##### How do organisations design the right CS system for their needs, and what factors should they consider during the feature selection process?
To design a CS system, organisations should align the platform with their specific goals while ensuring usability and engagement.

Here, key Factors to Consider in Feature Selection:
1. Target Audience & Engagement Model:
   - Who are the participants (general public, professionals, students)?
   - Will participation be voluntary, incentivized, or required?
2. Data Collection & Management:
   - What type of data will be collected (images, text, GPS locations, sensor readings)?
   - How will data quality be ensured (AI validation, expert reviews, peer moderation)?
3. Collaboration & Communication Features:
   - Should users interact (e.g., discussion forums, voting systems)?
   - Will there be co-creation tools, where users help shape research questions?
4. Scalability & Security:
   - Can the system handle large-scale participation without performance issues?
   - How will user data privacy and security be managed?
5. Integration with Other Systems:
   - Does it need to connect with research databases, machine learning models, or government platforms?
6. Sustainability & Funding Model:
   - Will it be grant-funded, ad-supported, or subscription-based?
   - How will long-term maintenance be handled?
##### How can organisations ensure that their CS system stays up-to-date and continues to meet their evolving business needs over time?
- To ensure long-term relevance, organisations must actively monitor, update, and improve their CS system.
- Best Practices for Maintaining & Updating a CS System:
  1. Regular User Feedback & Iteration:
     - Conduct surveys, focus groups, and analytics reviews to understand whatâ€™s working.
     - Allow users to suggest improvements directly in the platform.
  2. Modular & Flexible Design:
     - Use API-driven architectures that allow easy feature additions.
     - Enable third-party integrations so new tools and datasets can be connected over time.
  3. AI & Automation for Efficiency:
     - Implement machine learning models to process large datasets and detect anomalies.
     - Use automated moderation to filter low-quality or spam contributions.
  4. Sustained Funding & Community Involvement:
     - Seek long-term funding from government grants, corporate sponsors, or research institutions.
     - Foster an active community that continues engaging with the platform even after launch.
  5. Security & Compliance Updates:
     - Ensure GDPR, data protection, and ethical AI compliance as regulations evolve.
     - Perform routine security audits to prevent vulnerabilities.
