# Task 1

#### 1. What is data governance, and why is it important for organizations?
**Data Governance**: The exercise of authority and control (planning, monitoring, and enforcement) over the management of data assets. It ensures that data is accurate, secure, compliant, and used effectively across an organisation.
**Importance:**
- Ensures **data consistency** and reliability for decision-making.    
- Enhances **regulatory compliance** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley).
- Improves **data security** and reduces risks of breaches.
- Increases **operational efficiency** by reducing data silos and redundancies.
- Helps **maximise data value** by making it a strategic asset.
**Example:**
- **Data Governance Definition:** A retail company like **Walmart** uses data governance to ensure that product pricing, inventory levels, and customer data are consistent across all stores and online platforms.
- **Why Important?** Without governance, Walmart might have different prices for the same product in different regions, leading to customer complaints and lost trust.
#### 2. How can data governance help ensure data quality, security, and compliance?
- **Data Quality:**
    - Establishes **data standards, definitions, and validation rules**.
    - Implements **data stewardship** to monitor and correct errors.
- **Data Security:**
    - Defines **access controls, encryption, and audit trails**.
    - Ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data.
- **Compliance:**
    - Aligns with **legal and industry regulations** (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS).
    - Maintains **documentation and auditability** for reporting.
**Examples:**
- **Data Quality:** A bank like **JPMorgan Chase** enforces governance rules to prevent duplicate customer records (e.g., merging "John Doe" and "J. Doe" into one profile).
- **Security:** **Apple** uses governance policies to encrypt customer payment data, preventing breaches like the 2014 iCloud hack.
- **Compliance:** **Amazon** follows GDPR rules by allowing EU customers to delete their data upon request.
#### 3. What are some challenges Company XY might face in implementing data governance?
- **Cultural Resistance:** Employees may resist changes to workflows.
- **Lack of Executive Support:** Without leadership buy-in, governance fails.
- **Siloed Data:** Legacy systems may hinder integration.
- **Cost & Resources:** Requires investment in tools, training, and personnel.
- **Measuring ROI:** Difficulty in quantifying governance benefits.
**Examples:**
- **Cultural Resistance:** Employees at **Target** might resist entering data into a new system, preferring old Excel sheets.
- **Siloed Data:** **Tesla** struggled early on because manufacturing and sales teams used separate databases.
#### 4. What benefits might Company XY see from data governance?
- **Better Decision-Making:** Reliable data leads to accurate insights.
- **Reduced Costs:** Fewer errors, redundancies, and compliance fines.
- **Improved Customer Trust:** Consistent, secure data enhances reputation.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlined processes and reduced rework.
- **Scalability:** Supports growth with standardised data practices.
**Examples:**
- **Cost Reduction:** **Netflix** saved millions by cleaning up duplicate subscriber records.
- **Better Decisions:** **Starbucks** uses governed data to track which drinks sell best in different regions.
#### 5. How can Company XY measure the effectiveness of its data governance program?
- **Data Quality Metrics:** Error rates, completeness, and timeliness.
- **Compliance Audits:** Number of violations or audit findings.
- **Security Incidents:** Reduction in breaches or unauthorised access.
- **Process Efficiency:** Time saved in data reconciliation.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Surveys on data usability and governance impact.
**Examples:**
- **Data Quality:** **UPS** tracks how often package tracking data is accurate (e.g., 99.9% correct delivery ETAs).
- **Compliance:** **Facebook** audits how often it meets GDPR requests within 30 days.

# Task 2

#### 1. What is data architecture, and why is it important for organisations?
**Data Architecture** is the blueprint for managing data assets, defining how data is stored, integrated, and accessed. It includes models, standards, and integration strategies.
**Importance:**
- **Eliminates Redundancy:** Avoids duplicate data storage.
- **Improves Integration:** Ensures seamless data flow between systems.
- **Supports Scalability:** Adapts to growing data needs.
- **Enhances Analytics:** Provides structured data for BI and AI.
- **Reduces Costs:** Optimises storage and processing efficiency.
**Example:**
- **Definition:** **Uber**’s data architecture defines how ride requests, driver locations, and payments flow between apps, servers, and databases.
- **Why Important?** Without it, Uber drivers might see outdated ride requests, causing delays.
#### 2. How can EDAM help improve data integration and reduce redundancy?
- **Standardised Models:** Enterprise-wide data definitions and relationships.
- **Master Data Management (MDM):** Single source of truth for critical data.
- **Data Lineage Tracking:** Maps data flows to identify inefficiencies.
- **Unified Metadata:** Ensures consistency across databases.
- **API & ETL Optimisation:** Streamlines data movement between systems.
**Examples:**
- **Integration:** **Airbnb** uses a unified data model so hosts and guests see the same booking details in real time.
- **Redundancy:** **Spotify** eliminated duplicate song records by merging databases, saving storage costs.
#### 3. What challenges might Company AZ face in implementing EDAM?**
- **Legacy Systems Integration:** Difficult to integrate outdated databases.
- **Flawless Data Transfer**: Ensure less or zero data loss, and maintain the application of these data.
- **Staff Training**: Related staffs need to be trained for the new workflow.
- **Require Data Expertise:** Requires skilled data architects.
- **Change Management:** Resistance to new data practices.
- **High Initial Cost:** Investment in tools and training.
- **Alignment with Business Goals:** Must balance technical and business needs.
**Examples:**
- **Legacy Systems:** **Ford** struggled to connect old factory systems with new IoT sensors.
- **Lack of Expertise:** A startup will initially lack data architects to scale its trading platform.
#### **4. What benefits might Company AZ see from EDAM?**
- **Faster Data Access:** Reduced latency in retrieving information.
- **Lower Storage Costs:** Eliminates redundant data.
- **Better Decision-Making across department and hospitals:** Integrated data supports analytics.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Clear data lineage for audits.
- **Future-Proofing:** Adaptable to new technologies (e.g., cloud, AI).
- **Stable Service**
- **Reputation and Customer recognition**
**Examples:**
- **Faster Data Access:** **Google** reduced search query times by optimizing its data architecture.

#### **5. How can Company AZ measure EDAM effectiveness?**
- **System Performance:** Query speed, data processing time.
- **Data Redundancy:** Reduction in duplicate records.
- **Integration Success:** Fewer errors in cross-system data flows.
- **User Adoption:** Engagement with new data tools.
- **ROI:** Cost savings vs. implementation expenses.
