# Task 3: Executive Summary
In this week's tutorial, we learned about how to boost a project while it is facing multiple constraints and different ways of mitigating it, I believe such methods can be applied and have been applied by everyone into any tiny or huge things just like a project, including me. However, this is the first time I got to do it in a very structured way, putting them down on notes, and get to do it with one case scenario. I personally find it hard but fulfilling after finishing this.

We did QMP by our own, getting a little peak at what is coming in our future work, it feels hard to be comprehensive and lots of brain storming ooof~. but accomplishing a decent level of the outcome (at least what we have thought) is very satisfying.

For the Gantt Chart, I personally am really bad at time management, but I tried following my feel of SDLC and kinda did it, so yay, and hopefully I will not refresh the page while I am crafting it as I am using online Gantt Chart tool, refreshing the page nils everything :.(
# Task 1: Project Acceleration
## Part 1
1. Resources are constraints and when they are not constraints.
	1. When resources are constraints:
		1. Optimise the project development routine.
		2. Put more time in.
		3. Prioritise more critical tasks and scope down.
	2. When resources are not constraints:
		1. Put more staffs.
		2. Parallel the workflows.
		3. Put better and automative equipments.
		4. Leverage external vendors.
2. Time is constraint (No Time Crunch).
	1. Prioritise more critical tasks and scope down.
	2. Focus more on key deliverables, meet Minimal Variable Product (MVP) first.
	3. Leverage more fundings if possible.
	4. Use more agile project management method (Extreme Programming).
3. Scope is constraint and when scope is not constraint.
	1. When scope is constraint (No Scope Creep)
		1. Plan early to retain a solid project development routine and structure.
	2. When scope is not constraint
		1. Scope up and down to include or prioritise based on the development progress to achieve faster on deliverables.
4. Quality is constraint
	1. Plan early with quality assurance measurements, such as testing and automation.
	2. Prepare quality-assuring guidelines.
	3. Communicate with stakeholders.
	4. Put more time.
	5. Put more staffs.
	6. Parallel the workflows.
	7. Put better and automative equipments.
	8. Leverage external vendors.
	9. Leverage more fundings if possible.
## Part 2
### Possible Constraints
- Budget Constraints: Limited money and resources available because other projects and events require additional investments.
	- To mitigate: Optimise the workflow to have better efficiency so required less human and hardware device resources. Prioritise key deliverables and scope down. Extend the project development timeline.
- Time Constraints: A 6-month job, and stakeholders require faster implementation about their new ICT Strategy.
	- To mitigate: Prioritise key deliverables and scope down. Aim for a Minimal Variable Product (MVP), Leverage more funding and investment. Use more agile project management method.
- Scope Constraints: Only certain tasks are being looked forward to appearing on the mobile app.
	- To mitigate: Plan early to retain a solid project development routine and structure.
- Quality Constraints: ACS is a national-wide association, as a leading role of ICT industry in Australia, their app cannot be too bad.
	- To mitigate: Plan early with quality assurance measurements and guidelines. Communicate with other stakeholders early to settle expected quality quotas at early stage.
- Governance Constraints: ACS might face a more strict governance as its leading role and deep relationship to massive amount of entities such as businesses, institutions, governments, and big-name individuals.
	- To mitigate: Invest more fundings on necessary lawful requirements and make sure the 100% of compliance.
# Task 2: Quality Management Plan (QMP)
- Quality Objectives:
	- The app runs with 100% in-scope functionality without crashing.
	- The app complies 100% of the industry standards or guidelines.
	- The app achieves 70% of user satisfaction upon their feedback after release.
	- The app will have at least 6 feature updates and 26 security / bug-fix updates rolled out in one year.
- Quality Standard:
	- Data Security: APP, GDPR, ISO 27001
	- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1, Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) (DDA), Google Lighthouse.
- Quality Assurance:
	- Roles:
		- Developers: Ensure functionality, usability / accessibility, and data security.
		- Tester: Report on Developer's work, find flaws and suggest improvements to adhere the objectives.
		- Project managers: Plan and setup development routine to achieve all the objectives beforehand the development.
	- Process:
		- Unit Testing / Integration Testing / System Testing
		- Usability Testing
		- User Acceptance Testing
		- Code Reviews
		- Lawyer Consultations
		- Risk Assessment
		- Penetration Testing
- Quality Control: 
	- Unit tests must be 100% passed.
	- Google Chrome Lighthouse test result > 95.
	- Zero major defects during usability testing.
	- No medium or high risks can be assessed.
	- All penetration testing failed to attack the system.
- Quality Reporting Procedures:
	- Change Control Process: A Change Control Process will be conducted for the project to ensure:
		- Efficient Communication
		- Avoiding disruption of development progress
		- All relevant entities notified
		- Non-relevant entities not disturbed
		- A request of change should only will be communicated and assessed with stakeholders who will be interested in this change, but not who will be focusing on it, all higher-level stakeholders supervising the projects as a whole should be notified at all times, and necessary meetings should be held.
	- Communication Plan: The communication of this project should include:
		- Regular Meetings: Status and Progress Reporting, every 3 days.
		- Required Meetings: Call upon required, when change control protocol triggers, or upon higher stakeholder's requests.
		- Team meetings: Small Meetings for teams / departments, daily.
		- IM Chat: Utilise tools like Slack or Discord, for public information share, Zoom or Phone Call for distant connection. Use as required.
	- Documentation: Every changes, audits, approved or rejected, must be signed with all relevant managers.
# Task 3: Gantt Chart

# Task 5: Papers
- Enslin, Zack. (2012). Cloud computing adoption: Control objectives for information and related technology (COBIT) -mapped risks and risk mitigating controls. AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT. 6. 10.5897/AJBM12.679.
	- This paper analysed COBIT’s role in IT governance and its relevance to cloud computing, cybersecurity, and digital transformation. This is literally a live sample of how ACS can use COBIT's domains to ensure IT strategy success, aligning with best practices in risk management, compliance, and performance monitoring. The findings confirmed that COBIT is essential for ACS’s ICT strategy, ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable digital services.

	- Communication in ICT Strategy - The article about business communication channels might relate to how ACS can improve communication with members using a mobile app, AI chatbots, or online services.
	- Digital Engagement & Online Presence – our report focuses on ACS growing its online presence worldwide. Some parts of the article (like emails, messaging, or video calls) could connect to how ACS interacts with members online and improves digital engagement
