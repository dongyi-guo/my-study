# Penetration Testing
* Aware with knowledge and tools for 715 and 726.
* Need 1-2 years of training only for this.
## What is it?
* Evaluation of the security 
    * Where are you vulnerable
## Goals
Find flaws in :
* Policies
* Specificatons
* Architecture
* Implementation
* S/w
* H/w
## Legal Considerations
- Because it is simulating what could be malicious, so BE CONSENTED. Permission must be obtained.
- You can not interrupt the normal business working.
## Type of Test
**Black-box (Zero-knowledge) Testing**
* You are outsiders.
**White-box (Inside-knowledge) Testing**
* Reveals more vulnerabilities
* Most likely faster
* Internal support needed
* Glass-box test
**Grey-box Testing**
* Some knowledge but not all the knowledge
## Structure of a Test
There is no fixed structure, depending on the goals.
Full-system could be 4 stages, could be more, all about how you draw the line and considering the goal settings.
Here, we have **7 Stages:**
1. Scope/Goal: What this company wants to test?
2. Information Gathering / Foot-printing / Recons 
3. Scanning / Enumeration / Vulnerability Detection
4. Information analysis and planning
5. Attack & Penetration / Privilege escalation / Maintain access (backdoor)
(You repeat Stage 2 - 5 to discover all vulnerabilities in the system, or you think you did.)
6. Documentation result analysis & reporting
7. Clean-up
(This should also be the responsibility for the clients.)
## Open Problems
Analysis Phase
* Tricky
* Time consuming
* Need high l skills
* As PenTester, you need to think out of the box for you own jobs, but no bad intentions
Pen Stage:
* Tools are unified
* Need config
* Need deep understanding of the computer architecture.
* Does not mean your client is safe now
Reporting the incidents
Clean-up
- Can be difficult, especially for clients
