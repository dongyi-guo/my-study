# Risk Assessment

## Threat Analysis

Two Steps:

* Identifying threats.
* Establishing likelihood of threat.

## Risk / Risk Assessment

Risk analysis allows us to know:

* Where an org is vulnerable?
* Which vulnerabilities will cause the most harm:
    * Money
    * Make a prioritised list
* Decisions made based on level of risk acceptable.

Risk analysis is eventually value assessment:

* How likely is it that each identified threat will eventuate? 
* What will be the loss to the org for each threat?
* What will be the cost?
    * Assess the value of any protective activities.
    * Do they cost more than what could be lost?
* Identified risks need to be managed.
* Risk management strategies need to be balanced.
* No management is perfect: what residual risk can you take?
* The amount of the risk you can take depends upon your org's risk appetite.

### Risk Appetite

* Startup: High risk, low cost.
* Blue chip: Low risk , high cost.
* The balanced is the best.

### Types

* Strategic risk
    * Evaluated at CIO level.
    * Consider the environment.
    * It will affect the whole company.
* Operational risk
    * Day to day functions and service

ICT risks impact on both strategic and operational risk.

## Risk Analysis

* Not exact science
* Deal with risk involves:
    * Estimation from expertise
    * Guess with statistics
    * Imprecise dollar amounts
* Fundamental basis for all computer security activity.
* Computer security techniques is a risk mitigation activity.

### Approaches

* Qualitative - level high, medium, low
    * Structured brain storming:
        * Prepare with structured questions
        * Informed by expertise
    * Tiger team
        * Expert examine and evaluate the system for know vulnerabilities.
            * Used in PenTest
        * Consultants
    * Structured list in Beyond Fear
        * What assets are being protected?
        * What are the risks?
        * How well does security solution mitigate those tasks?
        * What other risks will be caused?
        * What costs and trade offs does this security solution impose? 
    * Approach described in Security in computing by Pfleeger & Pfleeger:
        * Identify assets
        * Determine the vulnerabilities
        * Estimate the likelihood of exploitation
        * Compute expected annual loss
        * Survey applicable countermeasures
        * Project annual savings for proposed measures
    * Attack trees: AND (Specifically designed) and OR (Natural of a tree), nodes and leaves
* Quantitative - Measured with amount of money
    * Formal assessment: AS 31000
    * Identify assets: H/w, s/w, data, people, documentation, supplies
    * Identify vulnerabilities: imagination plus tables
    * **AS/NZS ISO 31000:2018**
    * 1.Predict incidence of each vulnerability
        * Observe, guess, history, likelihood
    * 2.Assign a cost to each possible loss
        * Dollar amounts listed
        * Legal penalty
        * Financial loss
        * Loss of reputation, market share, competitive edge
        * Guesses known as expert estimates
    * 3.Think of and cost new measures which would decrease the likelihood of attack estimates
    * 4.Work out which of these bring savings.

### Starting Points

* Possible vulnerabilities and threats
* Assets need to be protected 

### Matrix Template

#### Likelihood

* Estimation of the probability that a threat will succeed in achieving an undesirable event
* 0.1 - 1.0
* Low 0-25%
* Medium 26-75%
* High 75-100%

#### How this matrix works

You cross the:

* Likelihood: High, Medium, Low
* Impact: High, Medium, Low

### Benefits of risk analysis

* Makes people value there assets maintained by computer systems.

* Provides guidelines for cost benefit analysis of possible security measures.

### Disadvantages of risk analysis

* Costly
* Guesstimate
* False sense
* Problems of overestimation and underestimation
